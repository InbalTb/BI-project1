R3I2DHQBR577SS,Five Stars,"Love this, excellent sun block!!"
R1QNE9NQFJC2Y4,Thank you Alba Bontanica!,The great thing about this cream is that it doesn't smell weird like all those chemical laden ones.  I get a nice healthy un-fake looking tan that isn't orange and it makes my skin soft too.
R3LIDG2Q4LJBAO,Five Stars,"Great Product, I'm 65 years old and this is all it claims to be!"
R3KSZHPAEVPEAL,GOOD DEAL!,I use them as shower caps & conditioning caps. I like that they're in bulk. It saves a lot of money.
RAI2OIG50KZ43,this soaks in quick and provides a nice base for makeup,"This is my go-to daily sunblock. It leaves no white cast at all and has a clean, pleasant scent. If you're a makeup wearer, this soaks in quick and provides a nice base for makeup. I've been using this brand for over a year. With daily use, this tube will last you a couple months."
R1R30FA4RB5P54,Four Stars,Good
R30IJKCGJBGPJH,Good buy,"Great eyeliner, does run just a little bit at corners at times, but overall, it does keep on your eyes all day long."
R18GLJJPVQ1OVH,Five Stars,Best makeup remover！
R8TVYIJXLYJT0,Tame the wild mustache,"This is a great product. I'm on my latest stab at a major beard, and I always seem to start growing them during the hottest months. My mustache is going through a particularly awkward phase of growth, and this wax really helps keep it in place, out of the way. I look neater and I can actually eat and drink again without collecting a big mess. If you're going to get this, do yourself a favor and get a good mustache comb."
R1CJGF6M3PVHEZ,but it's like having nothing on them at all,"I thought it would darken the lashes even though it's clear, but it's like having nothing on them at all. Sadly I threw it away."
R2A30ALEGLMCGN,Good Product,"These are great for small mixtures for EO's, especially for traveling.  I only gave this 4 stars because of the orifice reducer.  The hole is so small it is hard to get the oil out.  Just needs to be slightly bigger."
R134GP1Y3EQZ1L,Optimum Oral Health,Just got this.  Nice size and very compact.  I am looking forward to the gum massaging.  I wore out my last model.
R6CE3SOIUJGP4,Love this cream !,Wish I had discovered this years ago ! Leaves my curles super defined and soft !!!. I still need to put on gel or spray for it to last though but it is super recommend it!
R37CDLQZUPDZVM,It works so much better than store bought lotion,I bought this to make my own lotion. I mixed the shea butter and coconut oil together. It works so much better than store bought lotion! I want to get some raw cocoa butter to mix in with the next batch.
R1KH9XCK6GYT26,Five Stars,The tint is awesome but seller don't even send one sample.
R3I4BQ6654MQNA,"Great product, fast delivery",I'm in love with this! It's so unique and fits with my decor beautifully.  Couldn't ask for a better seller.  Received product before date promised.
R3LUPG356F1D40,Does not smell cheap!,"I was given this product in exchange for a review. All I can say is wow!!!! I love perfume, and this is a great scent! The notes are a little heavy but i really like it overall. I get headaches easily, but this doesnt seem to do that with me. Does not smell cheap!!! It is a wonderful fragrance for not a lot of money! I love it, you should give it a try!"
R3HNVRTHL9S2ZB,Five Stars,Magical everybody noticed a skin change right away
R5HKL5RD4IUT8,Love this Razor/Trimmer,"Works fantastic! The razor leaves my legs really smooth unlike most disposable razors I've used. The razor runs acrossed your skin so smoothly you don't feel like its doing anything. The trimmer is a trimmer it trims, not meant for down to the skin shave but it gets close enough so you can just run the razor through and boom smooth!"
R37Z8NBTHPR853,Five Stars,excellent battery tooth brush
RD8F1K5G9W1VX,"Works Okay As A Styling Aid, But Doesn't Give My Straight Hair A Fun Beachy Look","This Tresemme product is for creating beachy looking hair whether you have curly or straight hair. But I have such straight hair without any real body so the beachy look just isn't a good look for me, unlike in my younger years when I loosely permed my hair and my hair would look great at the beach even after swimming in the ocean half the day. I tried twisting my hair and styling per the instructions for straight hair, and it just didn't look good at all. My hair ended up looking stringy, sloppy and unstyled. To be fair, I don't think any spray on product could give me that awesome beachy look due to my straight hair type.<br /><br />If I spray this Tresemme on my damp hair and blow dry as usual with a round brush, it does adds a little lift, volume and texture to my straight hair. But it's just one more product to add to the routine as it doesn't substitute for my hair gel or any other product, and I still need to finish with my Zero Weight Gel for shaping, hair separation and taming flyaway hairs. This Tresemme may work great for curly or wavy hair, but for my straight hair it doesn't create an attractive beachy look. While it does work okay as a styling aid, it's just one more product to add to my routine that I can live without. It's just okay."
R3N2C08ZJJ6SY1,5 stars!,My skin feels so soft and smooth since using this!
R1NV38DF3KQG9R,Even my Dentist didn't know!,"If you have dry mouth, these lozenges will solve your problem during the night. But don't take anyone's opinion, including mine, just invest in one box and find out the truth for yourself."
RCP1Z3UBYTWTZ,Great shave.,Ditch the plastic. Great shave.
R2MNWYYJQ3NOYA,Great sensitive eye cream!,This is a perfect lightweight eye cream and it's sensitive as well which is an extra bonus because we all know how sensitive the eye area can be! I am going to continue using this eye cream!
R26I0TOLTRCJNF,Fun Item,Love the different tip sizes
R1O5HZBOVLX8CY,Two Stars,This was not what I expected.
R3C6ALUXJ3M0E0,Great Lashes!,Great bargain! I love these lashes! Another great dupe for the Red Cherry Lashes!
R1MASIM5NHR9G4,Great product at a great value,Great product at a great value! I have gone through my first bottle of this and it has been the best benzoyl peroxide product I have ever used. Having the pump bottle is a nice feature.
R2P08VELITQHHG,I use to get another one of the Sonicare brushes ...,I use to get another one of the Sonicare brushes but that model would die 3 months in. I found this and this brush is cheaper than the one I was using before. This one works just as well and I haven't had it die on me in the many months I've had it. Very well worth the money.
R2ZFYF38D5Y9YS,They're okay...,"These powder puffs are pretty much okay, I just wish they were fluffier and bigger."
R2QRUE9REK8OUC,Better Than Any Pedi,"First off, I'll say I'm skeptical. I've tried tons of products promising new skin and heels so fancy, you'll never want to wear shoes, again. Nothing worked. My heels are probably typical of most women who go to the gym, wear sandals all summer, and wear those &#34;cute&#34; shoes that kill us. I use the Pedi Egg and various &#34;sanders&#34; from Beauty Brands each time I shower. Though the simple things like homemade foot scrubs, sanding, and lotion can help, nothing, and I mean nothing, worked like this product! After weeks and weeks of researching and humming and hawing, it went on sale and I bought it. Here's my tip to success: Soak feet. Take a nice long bath. I used bubbles, made myself some nice tea, brought in my iPad and watched about 40 minutes of TV to pass the time. (I hate baths. This part was the hardest for me.) Then I dried my feet a little, and while still prune toed from the bath, slipped the pre-gel booties on and put on a pair of my husband's socks over them to help keep them in place. I left mine on for 90 mins (suggested by a blogger) and then rinsed them off. My feet had a sheen to them and smelled nice but that was it. A watched foot does not peel. Day 2: Soaked just my feet in a foot bath for 30 mins. Nothing exciting but my feet felt relaxed from the hot water. Day 3: Whoa. My big toe, previously callused, peeled a little. I couldn't help but pick a tiny bit to reveal all this new skin under what felt like a giant mound of dead skin. Day 4: The sides of my feet started to peel some along with my heels a tiny bit. I continued to soak daily from 20-45 mins. I also have been wearing socks and sneakers all week. I've also sent out texts to multiple friends who were disgusted. Day 5: The magic starts to happen! More peeling...even around my toenails where I thought nothing bad was happening. Apparently, dry dead skin resided there, too. Right now I'm on Day 8: The majority of the peeling is over. I have been taking daily foot soaks/baths, using a washcloth to rub off dead skin during the foot bath, and today I peeled a little by hand because I couldn't help myself. Not much more peeling is happening. There's a few bits here and there but as I lay in bed, rubbing my once sandpaper feeling feet together, images of silk feet pop in my head. They feel so nice and the cracks and calluses are gone! I'll probably shed another day or two and be done with it. I'll buy this product, again, and will recommend this over any expensive pedicure any woman dare try (and I've even done the pedi where they razor cut your skin off your heels!). This is worth it. I have felt no pain. My feet look amazing. There's really nothing to it besides trying to hide your feet during the molting. If you're diabetic or have allergic reactions to any of the fruit acids or alcohol, it's not recommended. If you &#34;help the peeling&#34; along, you could hurt yourself. Those are just some warnings on the package it comes in. Happy shedding, everyone!a washcloth to rub off dead skin during the foot bath, and today I peeled a little by hand because I couldn't help myself. Not much more peeling is happening.

RVHCXMEY80SGB,Great Product,Just as advertised.  Works much better than manual toothbrush.

R3SRUOY8ETBDFL,Five Stars,Was a gift.  My friends loved it
R23REI1P4U50Y6,So Refreshing,The item arrived on time and was as a described. I usually stay away from rose scented products but I like the way this rosewater smells and it's not too overwhelming. I use it as a refresher for my face on these hot humid days.
R31IWERY6019Z1,Five Stars,very good
R31P0KLYS24Y7K,Five Stars,As always
R1V3QWZ5919M3K,Wonderful product,"I got my package 8 days after ordering, honestly i think thats very good timing. Everything that was advertise was correct, As you can see in the photos. Im very pleased with the out come of the shape and the fact its a little longer than your nail. They arnt to thick to where it would be an issue but arnt thin to were they out snap either, kinda in the middle. I didnt have to file them to much, just a little on the top due to there being a bit of rough edges. Also used some 100% acetone to get them off and it worked perfectly. I highly recommend this product by the seller if you are looking at these types of fake nails."
RW70OUSBVWMLT,Fantastic products :D,"I received the clogged pores natural cleansing kit about ten days ago. Since then, I have been using it daily to wash and moisturize my face.<br />First, let me strt with the presentation. The kit came in a very cute package box. I really liked how pretty it ws. It definitely looks like a good gift for a friend. I love the containers the products renin. The box for the soap opens up like a flower and holds the bar in the place. The lotion is in a very secure glass jar that feels like both very high quality and durable. Both products look very nice on my counter.<br /><br />The soap smells very wonderful. I really like washing my face with it as it does not leave it dry nor sticky like some cleansers do. I cut up the soap into four squares so that I can control how much I use of it better.<br /><br />The moisturizer is my fvorige part. It feels so wonderful on my skin! Just a little of it is enough to cover my whole face-- though sometimes I do two layers because I enjoy the feeling of it. It really is very nice and feels wonderful.<br /><br />As for the effectiveness of the products, I have been using em for 10 days and my face does feel a little cleaner, smoother, and softer. It's not a dramatic change, but I have only been using it for a short time. I expect greater results with time and will update this review accordingly. Thank you Aya Natiral!"
R3F43G543HH7BX,Five Stars,Absolutely love this fragrance.<br />I always get compliments when wearing it.
R14VEDRPU4KL6M,Very pleased with it,Very bright to apply make up. Very pleased with it..
R2D3DVAG9NOZ3S,Meets the need temporarily n,Good product.
R2K7SZZPIMNJKY,Very good product. Ships quickly,This is my 2nd bottle.  Very good product.  Ships quickly.
R19RE4JO8O8D56,wonderful eyeliners (some of the only pencils I will use),"These are excellent eyeliners and some of the only &#34;pencil-style&#34; eyeliners I will use.  I normally have trouble with pencils, but these are not hard at all and actually show up well, even if you are not that skilled at applying pencil liner (which I am not).<br /><br />These really do shimmer just a little.  But you are not trying to put large bits of glitter next to your eye, either.  Some of the lighter colors (i.e., gold) don't show up super well on pale skin, especially if you are also wearing a shimmery eyeshadow.  So keep that in mind.  (The gold would look awesome on darker skin without shadow, and I can make it work without shadow on my pale skin, as well.)<br /><br />These last all day under any one (or more) of the following conditions:<br /><br />(1) If you don't have oily eyelids<br />(2) If you use a setting powder or finishing powder (like the translucent one from e.l.f.)<br />(3) If you wear them over primer and powder eyeshadow<br /><br />If you have oily eyelids and don't do #2 or #3 above, this will migrate (trust me -- been there, done that).<br /><br />I wear contact lenses and have somewhat sensitive eyes but these do not give me any trouble, which is great.  They come off easily enough with a makeup remover wipe; you don't need any special remover to get them off.<br /><br />Please note: You should definitely shop around to get the best deal.  The manufacturer has some good deals, especially during the holiday shopping season."

R1RI19FYJE6DIM,Three Stars,Did not help me I feel it makes it worse still have bags under my eyes.
RWBW8IV6X4XBI,Satisfied,"Very nice hair gel. Pleasing scent, holds my medium longish hair down all day. I've noticed that I don't have to use as much as other gels to keep my hair down, and it doesn't become as cement-like when you do. Holds my hair down even when I'm at work sweating all day. It also washes out easier than other gels at the end of the day, so easier to clean up also. Would recommend to a friend."
RYRV10WKQ3TCY,Good buy,"The color is great -- comparable, if not better than, NARS liquid lipstick in Daredevil. That's not to say it's a dupe... The consistency and finish is different. The most noticeable thing about the finish here is that it's patchy. I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker, especially because at a brick-and-mortar store, I bought this for $3.99, sight unseen (no tester). It IS matte, it dries somewhat quickly, but ends up being quite thick on. The color is very chic, although it's a little different than the photo, I'd say less muted/less burgundy. It's a good buy. Just not the highest quality, because of the patchiness.<br /><br />[edit] I was writing this review for the color Backstage, but I see the colors are kind of all mashed into one listing.<br /><br />The color Stunner is another one I have -- and the only thing I have to say about is that if you think it's &#34;too purple,&#34; go ahead and spend five bucks on it. It's probably not too purple. It's just purple enough."

Happy I found this product!"
R2AE3B44XQO9OJ,One Star,Burned my under arms and I gave it someone else.  Would not buy again
R1GXFYG24TL2XL,Bad quality frames,These are nice looking glasses.  The arms to the glasses are two pieces connected together.  When I opened the glasses I noticed that one of the arms was not connected and slid apart when putting the glasses on and off.  I contacted Amazon to return the glasses and order a replacement pair.  The replacement pair arrived on Saturday and guess what?  The exact same problem.  Both pair are now being returned.  Horrible quality.
R1J4X17M2G2T5A,"Not smudge proof, but amazing.","Great Mascara, big tube with a triangular top. The ONLY downside I have to this mascara is that it is not in fact smudge proof, nor waterproof. I have blonde eyelashes, that are very full and long, so when I wear black mascara I tend to look like I have falsies on.  I want a mascara that is going to stay put, and make them look even fuller. This mascara is perfect with that, it's a smaller wand making it easier to apply. Only 1 coat is needed for a dark, full looking set of eyelashes. I do love it.<br /><br />sample provided"
R3N77VRU8Q2C,Was extremely disappointed in the size of the products I ordered,"Was extremely disappointed in the size of the products I ordered.

R1DFD8356JKDR4,Not really what I had ewxpected.,I like men’s facial products and Clubman is a favorite of mine.  I got this facial product not really knowing what it does other than sooths irritation.  What I found in this product is nothing that special.  When you first put it on you will be overcome by the alcohol smell.  It does dissipate past though. Imagine ispropyl alcohol in a gel form.  What the remaining scent is smells like floral – not clubman like at all.  It is not overpowering though and disappears fast.  The product does dissipate quickly – or maybe absorb into your skin?  What you are left with is a sticky and tacky feeling skin.  I have been putting on a moisturizer or balm because I can’t imaging leaving your facial skin alone after putting this stuff on.<br />Will use it up but will not be purchasing again.

It turns out this product really does seem to work.  My biggest concerns were breakouts, wrinkles, and sun spots.  I had been using a prescription Retinol product to deal with these issues.  I have since substituted that product with this serum and have been extremely  happy.  I only use it at night under my moisturizer.  Would highly recommend it."
R2FE3RNUT6NIH1,High Quality Sleeping Mask That Contours To Your Face,"I live in a very street-light lit area. Even with black-out curtains I have trouble falling asleep. One thing I've noticed that really helps are sleeping masks. With that being said, I've tried quite a few and I haven't found one that completely blocked out the light or was comfortable to wear. This mask is different, and possibly one of the best I've ever worn to bed. I purchased a homemade one on Etsy that is still my favorite (because I like the owl print on it), but this one is half the price and just as good in quality- which is why I'm rating it 5 stars.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about this sleeping mask was the thickness. No light is going to get through this mask! It seems a little bulky at first- especially if you're used to the thin silk masks that are commonly sold. With that being said, once you get used to wearing something like this you'll notice a significant difference in the amount of light that gets through. It truly does create a blacked out environment that is really nice.<br /><br />The mask fit my head perfectly. I have pretty average head size, so I think I can fairly say that this mask can be adjusted to fit anyone. The mask can be adjusted with little sliding adjusters and then has a clasp in the back that secures the mask around your head. The company boasts that the clasp won't snag in hair- and I have very snaggly fine hair. So far it hasn't gotten tangled in my hair, although sometimes I do accidently clasp a few strands of hair into the clip and it pulls them out when I roll around. I just put my hair in a low pony tail to avoid that problem.<br /><br />One thing that I really love about this mask is that it's contoured to fit around the bridge of your nose. Most sleeping masks don't adequate fit around your nose so have small gaps where light can get through. That is not the case with this mask. Because it fits snug around all of the curves of your face- literally no light gets through. That is something that my Etsy eye mask did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask. I have a Jewish nose (a big nose) and it fits well over it.<br /><br />Overall, I do really like this mask. The clasp sometimes clips onto your hair (but that's my own fault for not being more careful), but other than that it's a great product. Very quality sewn and made with good materials. It has a very pretty leafy design (I got the Emerald Forest print) and fits well to my face. I'd definitely recommend this mask for anyone looking for a sleep aid. It'd make a great gift too, and comes in a very pretty box!k did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask.

R13VOB3BYSVIB1,I like the mouthwash,I like the mouthwash. It has a great taste and seems to work. I do feel like my mouth is cleaner and the taste is pretty good. There is a slight after taste but I am not sure how to describe it. At first it tasted a little like bubble gum but then it changes back to mint. It does not burn so that is a real plus. I hate when mouthwash burns.<br />[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]

R25BITGHETA2GI,Five Stars,very good products and quick service Thank you.
R2POXRW6PXHXZG,Great Crimper,This is a great crimper but a bit more than I can handle. My hair is fine and thin and I wanted this product to create a better root boost. It works wonderfully but I actually bought another one in a smaller size that is easier for me to handle. I would highly recommend this - it's a great product. I just needed smaller in size and inches to accommodate my fine hair.
R1FNUA2217TAAV,Five Stars,I absolutely LOVE this polish!!
R3JX1MAOABL6F1,It's a 4 pack that feels pretty good and the smell is neutral,"One thing to note is this is a dry version which is what I look for in deodorant. It's a 4 pack that feels pretty good and the smell is neutral, not overly strong which I prefer. The price for the most part saves you a good $3-4 in comparison to buying each stick individually or at a retail store so that was the biggest selling point for me. It will last me a long time, not much else to say about it except it does what I want it to do. I will say some people may not like the white chunks. You know when you smear the deodorant it might break off into pieces so that is something to note, but it doesn't bother me as it's the type I usually go for."
R19SKNB5CI5JCC,Love it. Prefer the tube stick but in AZ ...,"Love it. Prefer the tube stick but in AZ in the summer, it would melt in the UPS truck, so the tin is the way to go. When winter comes and temps drop into the 60s, I can order the more convenient stick. Mango is my absolute favorite lip balm. So smooth, the perfect lip moisturizer."
R213QB2E6VYEI3,Great,"No complaints from my wife, and buying from Amazon is so easy and so cheap."
RZNV6X8QSGBO1,I am enjoying it BUT,I am enjoying it but I wouldn't spend this much again. I like gardenia scents a lot but this one is so similar to other gardenia scents that would cost far less.

R3MZ5OESAIZN62,Color is completely wrong,"Havent had a chance to actually use the product, still waiting on base/top coat to come but was very disappointed when I opened this package and saw the color. I thought I was buying a blueish color w some speckles, almost like night sky.... Just like their picture shows. Turns out they really meant it's PINK. There are some blue speckles but this is polar opposite of the picture provided on Amazon. Ordered a few other colors which I am still waiting for, really hoping I'm not going to be disappointed in those colors also. If I would have waited to buy other colors until I tried this one I never would have purchased another color. I guess if you want to play color roulette with your purchases then this would be perfect for you, but if you want to use the color you actually intended to buy then I probably would shop around more. Here's to hoping the other colors are better and the product itself is actually worth it."

R5TB74ZZY6HR,Great Price!,To be honest our household has not used many Tresemme products until now. The first thing that I noticed was the price-very reasonable. But does it work or why bother? It does a decent job on my wife's hair and she likes on her curly tangles. I liked the smell and worked well with the way that I designed my hair that particular day.<br /><br />Great price for above average product!
RLZI7QPQFJEOI,nice color,I like this color Rose Rapture but it has to be applied with a heavy hand to get it to look like in the pan; color is much paler on the skin. I have used it to lighten up/ soften/ correct a cheek color that went on a bit too dark.

It's a clear gel like liquid and it goes on very smooth, and as far as I have noticed It hasn't caused any skin irritation. I have very sensitive skin and most products either cause a break out, or redness. I don't get that with this, it has just really left my skin looking great overall. I will purchase this again. I use both morning and night."

It is very unique because there are real flowers inside of the mix.  It comes with a mini spatula to give it a good stir prior to use.  I got this at a discount to try and give my unbiased and honest review.  Opinion is my own.  I hope you will splurge on one for yourself or have someone buy one for you as a gift!  You won't be disappointed.  As a matter of fact, you may come on here thanking me for the suggestion.  There is truly no other product quite as special as this one is to me.

RGV1J81WG20AQ,Trusted and true product,"I started using this product many years ago when I was wearing my hair longer. For the last several years, it was very short and didn't really need conditioning. Recently, I started letting my beard and my hair grow long again, so I resumed my use of this trusted and true product. The Classic Clean version is not always easy to find because of all the specialty types that have come out. This product leaves my hair clean, soft and manageable. It has a nice fragrance too. And of course the fact that the incredibly gorgeous Miss Gomez is now the spokes person doesn't hurt my opinion either."

R867QFCOCN0JC,A beauty industry professional's expert opinion,"Most masks on the market are watered-down with &#34;Water&#34; as the first ingredient, making the active ingredients diluted and less potent. Not this one from Nugg. The first 3 ingredients are Aloe Juice, glycerin, and Olive oil. This concentrated combo creates a soothing, hydrating emulsion that effectively draw moisture to skin and help it stay there. The texture is thick and substantial and stays on the face, no drips.<br /><br />I also like that there is no artificial fragrance or colorants (who needs that?).<br /><br />After just a few minutes, you'll need a washcloth to wipe off the excess and then rinse. Just rinsing alone is not enough to dissolve the thick layer of hydration. A simple moisture mask that does what it says.<br /><br />Deceptively small in size, one pod is more than enough to cover one's face and neck."

R23ZJ6NA5HFWKJ,"Great to keep them white, not so great to get them there.","I was able to try this product for free courtesy of Crest, and I thought it was a great maintenance whitener. I am a heavy coffee drinker and for the approximate month I used this product my teeth didn't appear to be getting any yellower. That being said....they didn't really appear to be getting any whiter either. It is really easy to use, Step 1 is a normal toothpaste and then you go right into Step 2 (no rinsing) which is the whitening gel. Anyone who has used Crest Whitestrips in the past will recognized the flavor of the gel (basically, hydrogen peroxide). The instructions state to use the product twice daily, and keep step 2 on your teeth for at least 1 minute each time. Maybe that is where I went wrong, I am only a once daily brusher and it was a minute(ish) of using the gel on only my front teeth. I didn't experiance any of the white spots on my teeth like I have in the past with the WhiteStrips, but I did get some gum soreness and bleeding. I like that this product doesn't really change my morning routine, and I think that I will continue to use it, but only after I get my teeth professionally whitened."

R3UWUW8AVVOPTL,Not So Great for Sensitive Teeth,I was super excited about whitening with this two step system from Crest. I have some stains from coffee and wine that I would love to see whitened. On the first day of use I could tell that my teeth felt ultra-smooth and polished. The taste was fine too. On the second day of use I noticed that my teeth were feeling more sensitive. I was previously using a sensitive toothpaste before switching to the Two Step system. On the third day I knew that due to increasing sensitivity I would not be able to continue with this product. I wish I could have continued on to see the whitening power of Crests Two Step System.<br />[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]

R2Z454UPBN3N9M,Excellent Straightener Especially For the Price!,"My Babyliss Nano Titanium straightener finally died (it kept turning off when I moved it - not a good sign) so I started doing research on a good straightener.  I noticed this Bebella brand had good reviews and the plates were ceramic.  It was also much cheaper than many other ceramic brands with lower ratings so I bought it.  I actually like it a LOT!  It heats up super-quick (60 to 90 seconds) and even on the lowest setting it can straighten my hair with one pass (I have fine hair, but there is a lot of it and it's very curly).  The part that you hold stays cool to the touch regardless of the heat setting and the iron can actually sit on the sink &#34;standing up&#34; and not heat up the counter.  There is also a red light on the top that lets you know it's on (it's a nice reminder if I'm in a hurry and forget to unplug it) and the temperature setting is inside the &#34;mouth&#34; of the iron, so you don't accidentally raise or lower the temperature while you're using it.  Another plus is the cord &#34;pivots&#34; from the base when you use it, which is excellent because it keeps it from getting twisted or wrapped around your hand while you're using it.  The product came in a pretty box but with no bag (I like a straight iron bag so I can travel with it and this one didn't have one - 1/2 star lost), so that was a slight negative.  But the best part of this iron is that my hair looks very shiny and healthy after using it and the style lasts all day (except on extremely humid days the straight style still frizzes some, but that's more of me not using the right hair products vs. the straightener, I think - plus humidity and curly hair don't mix no matter what you do).  I don't know if my old straightener was going &#34;bad&#34; for longer than I thought, but I can't remember the last time it did as good a job as the Bebella does.  I was very impressed with it.  The one issue I had was my hair does not always slide straight through the plates.  I'm not sure if that'sbecause they're floating plates or not, but I had to dock another 1/2 star for this issue.  If I'm straightening my hair, it's never a problem, because I can stop if it gets caught, re-brush out the problem section and finish straightening it.  It occurs when I curl my hair.  It's not a huge deal, because it doesn't happen with every section of hair, but when I'm trying to curl my hair with the straightener, I can't stop to re-brush out the section - you lose the momentum and end up straightening the section instead.  However, I have never been able to curl my hair with a straightener like I can with this one so it's worth the slight aggravation (again - not a constant issue, just an occasional one).  Plus the curly style lasts all day no matter what (humidity or otherwise).  I also read several reviews where customers were disappointed that there were no instructions included in their box. Trust me, there's nothing to miss, because mine came with instructions and they were basically safety instructions.  I was looking for them because I wanted to know how the manufacturer recommended using the straightener to make a curly hairstyle (it advertises as a product that can do both - straighten and curl).  However, there were no instructions on how to use the product at all - not to straighten or curl.  But like pretty much everything else, you can just go to youtube and find multiple posts of girls curling their hair with a straightening iron (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdy6OQcpklA and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVHP49g5IPQ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_KxtTVMOxQ are a few) .  They are excellent tutorials and there are multiple ways to do it.  This straightener works with them all - you just have to be patient and find a rhythm, making sure you are letting the hair have enough time as you are pulling it through, to evenly heat the entire section, but not leaving the heat on for a long time at any one point, because then it will straighten (which is whyit's such a pain when my hair catches between the plates).  It actually creates perfect spiral curls all the way to soft waves depending on how long you spend on each section and how high you have your heat setting.  And it takes me (with LOTS of slightly-below-shoulder-length hair) less than 15 minutes to style all of my hair in either style (curly or straight).  Honestly, if you had to have only one product between a straightener, a curling iron, curlers or an &#34;Insyler&#34; curling iron, you could just get this straightener, because you can do all of the same styles with this one product as you can with all of those products put together.  I highly recommend this straightener and will be getting at least one more for Christmas gifts this year!"

R29C072LTI59PB,Maybe I Should've Checked The Reviews Before Purchasing,"The colors are much lighter than they appear in the photos. I was excited for a palette not just only catered to fair skin and white people but was disappointed. I thought they were darker colors as the picture shows but was I can only use them as highlighters, for the arch of my eyebrows, etc. Its not necessarily a bad palette but just works best for fair skinned and white people."

R3JQVFWTVSWCZR,It truly is a wonderful product that works as it claims,"I recently wrote a review this product, trashing it without properly trying the product. I need to change my review because the stuff does what it advertises. This new review correctly states that the product itself works GREATLY!!!!! As I used it the way instructed. I'm sorry if my previous review affected this products sales for in anyway, That's my fault. It truly is a wonderful product that works as it claims."
RE4XDLX5KPAMN,Effective exfoliator,"I have been using the alpha hydrox lotion on the dry areas of my feet twice a day for about 4 days now.  I have seen a noticable difference in the amount of dead, rough skin in those areas making them feel smoother and more hydrated.  After reading about alpha hydroxy acids on Wikipedia, it sounds like this affect comes from exfoliation of the outer layers of skin cells.  A little scrubbing on the dead skin areas results in much easier removal of the dry stuff supporting that idea.<br /><br />After only 4 days, I am very happy with the results of this lotion.  I cannot yet speak to the effects of long term use, but I will continue to use the product as winter sets in - a cold, dry experience in Michigan.  If the dryness and cracking that I usually see in the winter are abated by the AHA lotion, I will call it more of a miracle.  As it is so far, the product does what I would expect and I am happy with it."

R35VU59MXE8GE2,Great quality. Short handle. Perfect if you wear glasses.,"These are the perfect brushes for someone who wears glasses and is nearsighted. I don't wear contacts every day and right now I can't wear them at all due to health issues. That means I have to get really close to the mirror to do my makeup. The handles in these brushes are short enough that I can use them very comfortably and actually see my eye.  But the brushes themselves aren't mini. I was surprised by how big the crease brush and large eye brush are in comparison to my ELF eye brushes. The large eye brush is so big I use it to contour my nose too. These are all very soft. I use each one and I'm thinking of picking up a second set so that I don't have to clean between colors as much. If you are looking for short good quality brushes I recommend you get the mini set too, because the eyeliner brush there is amazing and the others are good too. I like to keep those two eye brushes inside the little pouch that comes with this and make my own little set."

Terrific product and SO worth the relatively small amount of money for it!  Doesn't take up much counter space at all, and vibrates powerfully for a good clean.  Time your brush for you so you get the recommended 2 minutes cut into 4ths (one for each quarter of the mouth).  Will stop if you press down to hard.  Only drawback is a 22-hour charge time from bottom to top, and a recommendation to fully discharge the battery at least every 6 months to preserve the rechargeable battery.  But a full battery lasts for 7 days of 2x/day brushing.  Glad I bought this!"

R2R9WMQ9SHWDG4,like the cinnamon flavor,I found that regular toothpaste was causing the inside of my mouth to regularly slough off tissue; like skin peeling after a sunburn. A woman at a local health food store told me about Eco-Dent and I've been using it for the last couple of years.  No more sloughing in my mouth and my dentist is happy with my hygiene.

I'm a convert to brush, cream and  single blade safety razor and  shaving after 45 years of multi-track shavers. Easy to use, wet brush and dip a bit of cream onto the bristles and lather up face. I shave only one or twice a week so I usually give it a second go for best results. Much quicker than multi-tracks​ because I don't spend so much time trying to get the hair and cream out of the shaver. It rinses right out, easy peasy."

R29Q748WSHZ3SN,Best hair restorer and leave-in conditioner.,"This is fabulous if you have processed or dry hair. I used to get my hair permed and colored, and it would get burned every so often, sometimes from styling it. This really helps to calm the frizz down and de-tangle, way better than salon stuff. It is also light enough that even though I have fine hair it doesn't weigh it down unless I get too crazy with it. Makes hair silky and more flexible when it's dry."

The problem is that when I put my finger over the end of the brush wand as I style my hair, the end cap spins and the brushes slide out place.  I spend most of my time trying to put them back in place.  Additionally, it does not feel like a heavy duty, quality appliance.

IMPORTANT: follow the instructions! If you apply too much and/or don't rub in right away, the lotion can get a bit tacky in your hands. I overdid things the first time and had to wash some off.<br /><br />Second Try and Beyond:<br />My second goaround with Carpe went much better! I made sure to use a small, pea-sized amount and rub in quickly. The lotion has a pleasant but not overwhelming smell, and I could tell right away that it was working. Like I said before, I don't sweat too much so for me Carpe &#34;working&#34; wasn't so much about getting rid of sweaty hands, but actually upgrading me to what we'll call &#34;supergrip&#34; status. It was now time to try Carpe in the field.<br /><br />Uses for a &#34;non-sweater&#34;:<br />My first use for Carpe was the tennis court. I got the idea from the cheesy video they made here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1NDUDFa_-E<br /><br />I was not disappointed. I've never noticed my racket slipping, but with Carpe it was like my racket was stuck to my hand! I definitely noticed a difference, and it meant I could spend less energy maintaining my grip and more time focusing on other aspects of my game.<br /><br />I'll be coming back here to give updates on other uses. Feel free to comment if you want me to test out any other applications of this product!"

RL4HCNJM607ER,Rapidbrow grows brows rapidly!,"I'm not typically a 'reviewer' but having purchased this because of its reviews, I'd like to help any one who may be on the fence about purchasing... I have been using consistently twice a day for 4 weeks now and I can not believe the amount of growth I have! I've been trying to grow out my over plucked/waxed/threaded eyebrows for over a year now, only plucking the occasional strays and leaving a vaguely sparse bushy shape.<br />I have more growth in the past month while using Rapidbrow than I have had in the year prior. I can not speak on whether or not you must continuously use this product to maintain the growth, but I can say it works to grow brows rapidly!"
R1DBT2Z5DZ42FO,Great At Home Whitening Maintenance!,I've been using this new Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing & Whitening System for a while now and I am loving it. I have tried at home-whitening before but haven't ever tried anything like this. It is so easy to use and I am so thrilled that it doesn't cause any sensitivity for me. I was able to try the product for free thanks to Crest. I will continue to use/buy this and I definitely recommend it.

R3JAPDIJ1T4NZL,but glad that I took a chance at this product,"I was hesitant to try this product due to my sensitive skin, but glad that I took a chance at this product. I love the results! For those thinking about buying, know that the instructions and info are in Korean. However, you can find this information online, so fear not. The consistency of the mask is very goopy and you have to work fast to get it distributed across your face, otherwise it starts bubbling up. The bubbling feels funny and can itch a bit. Also, be warned that it feels a bit warm. I initially thought it was burning my face, but it's just residual heat from where the oxygen is creating a chemical reaction- thus the bubbling. After rinsing it off my face was soooooo smooth! Just make sure to put on some moisturizer because your skin will be a bit dry. In all, if you are on the fence about buying this product, give it a try! It's fun and totally worth the results!"

Plus, they smell AMAZING!<br />These are really great products that I highly recommend that you try out for yourself!<br />I also love that they have no artificial colors, no artificial additives, or impurities and it is not tested on animals (and no ingredients are derived from animals, totally Cruelty Free!<br /><br />***I did receive this product at a discount or complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

R2PGX9FT0KGG6Z,Feels like it is tighting up the area although,"I thought this cellulite cream was more runny than cream-like cream that I was expecting.  .The cream does seem to give the skin a softer, more even look.  Feels like it is tighting up the area although, I have not used the product long enough to say for sure.  However it does seem like something is happening.  After applying the product and washing your hands it feels a little tacky.  It seems like the skin on your fingers are tightening.  This goes away after about 10 minutes or so.  I hopefully it works as well as it says!<br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review. Despite the discounted item, my opinion remain 100% honest and my own."

RB7FTIK01FI6Z,Strong scent,"Watch out, it's scented! I didn't realize when I purchased it that this powder has an artificial perfumey smell that I can't compare to any smell that exists in nature. It's pretty strong and when I wear this powder, I get whiffs of the scent throughout the day. I don't like this smell, and I generally prefer unscented products. Still, the powder works well to reduce shine and even out skin tone. (But you probably shouldn't rely on the included brush.)"

R1QW0M1IWDND91,Amazing!,"Must admit I was skeptical at first.  Grow lashes, Really? And for $55  what am I thinking???  I’m 60, my lashes were very short and thin.  Even had a blank spot where there were no lashes at all.  Now, about a month later I’m so impressed!  Not only are my lashes longer (still waiting for fuller) but the blank spot is no longer there!  Lashes grew in!  Amazing product.  I use at night after washing up for bedtime."
R3EI7BIMTWU89X,"It smells very good, but my main complaint was that for the ...","Does not last very long when applied.  Maybe an hour or so? It smells very good, but my main complaint was that for the price it should last a lot longer."
R2C5NVLOLYPSG,"The Coloring was done by those that are visually impaired, or those who don't think well","Well now.....it's not the style, my hair is African twisty, curly, coily hair and it's fairly long.....the front of my hair has blonde tones, it hides any approaching gray :)....this wig can be styled also....I wanted to use it to give me and my hair a break from every other night twists. steaming, Shea butter and all the things that go on with African hair that's not wash and wear.....well the blonde in this wig, which is shown on the color chart(would be the reason I chose it) has all of the blonde hair at the back underneath the long reddish-brown hair....now that's about as backwards as can be, and they don't show that in the pictures....hmmmm....it is a lace top, which I cut back, because my hair would have matched the wig, almost perfectly, my hair has a little less texture....but nonetheless I would have rated it  5 stars if the color had been placed correctly.....if color is not your issue....they get it, if not....spend your money more wisely than I did...."

And it's a waste to return they say once the bag is open they won't take it back !!! I don't even wanna give this product even a star but They made me
R2HJMRRX7NA09M,"Product Okay, Delivery Mechanism Needs Improvement","I would give five stars if the bottle could spray at all angles. In order to reach &#34;that&#34; specific area, you kinda have to use the bottle upside down (unless your arms are so long to wrap all around you and you are a contortionist). This worked while the bottle was still fairly full. But now that it's fallen below 50% fill level, it already won't spray anymore unless it's exactly upright (not even slightly slanted). I suppose I could decant it into a smaller bottle, but I really wish the manufacturer could come up with something more practical (360-degree spray bottle, or maybe wipes?)."
RTXQRKAAX04PO,Works great!,"Such a fantastic product! Eve Hansen is great, I love all the products, makes my skin and hair look and feel 100x better. And it makes me feel good to know that I am using high quality products. And not some random stuff i got at the drug store."

RDZRQA374JD4W,Not For Me,"This cream absorbs quickly into the skin, is non greasy & light in texture.  Aloe Vera does great things at different times for skin but has not done much as a softening agent for my feet.  Maybe this cream is good for burning feet."

R12KML5RQY78SE,I also love how soft these brushes' bristles are--they don't feel prickly ...,"I honestly bought this on impulse because I didn't really need this brush set, but I bought it anyway mostly because of how badly I wanted the deluxe crease brush, and just partly because I know I'd use the rest of the brushes every now & then anyway. If only Real Techniques would sell the deluxe crease brush on its own, I'd definitely get myself another one. I mainly use it to blend my under-eye concealer and to cover up some small blemishes, and it does the job seamlessly. I also love how soft these brushes' bristles are--they don't feel prickly whatsoever on my lids (a peeve I have with other brands), and they pick up and distribute product very well. The quality of these brushes is amazing and you just can't beat the price. Great buy."

R3OH2PC749ADSB,Small difference,I ordered 5 bars twice and I must admit that I have noticed a modest change in the tone of my skin. Its a little more even and bright. I'm pretty sure if I ordered the 5 bar pack 2-3 more times I could have perfect skin but I'm not willing to spend that much more money so I just purchased lactic acid instead for a day peel. This is a good gradual product. Slow but you will get results over the course of 3-4  months of daily use.

I'm ordering more today because I have another tattoo I'm getting Sept 11. Also Before I went to the Tattoo shop I used Dr Numb cream and applied it where I was getting the tattoo. left that on for a hr. I also put the saran wrap over the Dr Numb cream and let that on for a Hr. My skin was so Numb when we started tattooing I didn't even know he was tattooing me. It was great! Love this Stuff. I just ordered 5 More tubes Of Dr Numb and more of this spray for me and my Gf. I Would never get another tattoo this out using this stuff. Love It! Oh and my Tattoo Came out great!!!!

R1O9L5REBIT5OA,Moyou London plates are amazing,"I love Moyou london plates! They have to be my favorite brand of stamping plates and i can't say enough good things about them! The designs are unique and you won't find them anywhere else. The etching is AMAZING and it is nearly impossible to mess up stamping with them. Alot of plates i own i have to be careful with my approach; how to scrape the polish away, how much pressure i put on the stamp, etc. With Moyou Londons plates it works everytime and i get a crisp clear image. I have ordered from them on their site as well and own a lot of their plates and they are amazing. I do love that they are available on amazon too though. Since they are based in London the shipping can be expensive to get to the US so having the option to get some of them for way cheaper shipping is great. They do free international shipping promos sometimes but in between those sales i love having a chance to get them from amazon."
R2LXIN8B7U0WP8,Five Stars,Works great to smooth and add shine to hair.
R2EG2KQKDF6E6Y,"Good shampoo, (I think) I am starting to see my hair thicken up.",I have been using this shampoo along with SheaMoisture Black Castor Oil Conditioner for not quite a month and it seems as my hair is getting more volume. I wash my hair about 2-3 times a week. Before I was able to go without a wash for a week. The shampoo/conditioner seems to make my hair greasy quicker. At this point this is not a big deal for me as long as I see regrowth.
R3V313ISO7HR7S,Four Stars,"The product arrived in a timely manner, and is exactly what I was expecting."
R2QSV1KEGJDPBP,You get what you pay for!,"You get what you pay for! I mean it is ok. It is made in China and the power cord is pretty short so one would need an extension cord really to use it say on your feet comfortably. The power adapter plugs straight into the back making it not extremely secure. An angle plug would be better at securing the cord to the drill. It works like a drill with a chuck type device that you loosen in order to put your &#34;bits&#34; into the tip. The adjustable speed is just a wheel switch and for me it seems like two speeds, when it first turns on, kinda low power and then pretty much full on. Others mileage may vary lol The body gets a bit warm during use, if, say you use it a bit like I did trying to reduce some thickened nails. It comes with some nice diamond tips, and I was also able to put my older &#34;FootSmart&#34; bits into it since I was using it on my feet. They were a slight bit thicker shank but it accepted them quite well but the receptacle looks like it is cheap aluminum (if you take the ring collar off and look at the insides). But, it works! Would be nice if it came in a nice storage box rather than the cardboard box and plastic insert. At least the &#34;bits&#34; are in a case but even that case is not an easy open design but it does protect the diamond bits and the sanding covers. To be fair, the FootSmart when I got it years agon was about $40 and now I think they want around $100 for it but all I need is a replacement drill. This will do for now and the price was good and a few improvements I would give it4 or 5 stars. But I feel it won't last long sooo you get what you pay for lol"

R13IBLWTSVG9QS,baffling ingredients' list for acne-prone skin,"I have chronic acne to such a degree that, without the help of several prescription topical and oral medications, I would be unable to keep my skin clear no matter what OTC products I used. This is a light, silicone-based moisturizer that, because of the silicone, broke me out terribly. Nearly everything else I have ever used, including straight vitamin E oil, has been better than this product. All it needs to make it completely toxic to breakout-prone skin is titanium dioxide. It's just as well this is no longer available in the US; there are dozens of moisturizers out there for acne-prone skin that are better than this one."
R2HKFZEXIK4WNA,IT'S GREAT!!!,Cushion Grip is WAY BETTER than all the other denture adhesives. The only thing is that it cost a bit much. Is there any way the price can come down some.<br />Thank You for allowing me to rate & write a review on Cushion Grip.

R3CKXQ8ZPFGWA2,They are a nice color and look very professional,"I received this Argon oil and tea tree shampoo and conditioner.  It comes in two large brown pump bottles.  They are a nice color and look very professional.  The have tried the shampoo and conditioner for a few days now.  The shampoo only requires one pump to clean my hair.  It lathers up nicely and makes my scalp tingle. It has a nice minty smell that seems to last for a while.  Then I only apply a very small amount of conditioner and rinse.  It has really helped my frizzies in my hair.  My hair looks soft, and silky looking.  My hair feels healthier.  I would recommend it.  I did receive this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion."

R3MDIHZU65XY77,Unfortunate change in packaging.,The packaging has changed and not for the better.  A plastic bag replaced the cylinder applicator and the customer is expected to transfer the contents.  The substance is light and very fine so a significant amount of it is lost in the transfer.  This change was not noted in the online description when I ordered.

RQQEJ2IJ0XU7,Very Small Compact,"I picked this up for touch ups after the gym. My foundation is there, just a little splotchy from the sweat, so this compact does the trick.

Sadly, it just doesn't seem to completely close around my hair, unless I work a large wad at one time.... not good.  After much frustration, after it sat in my drawer unused for so long, I donated mine to Goodwill just to reclaim the dead space."
R1JF1OM4WZ8XW4,Can't Miss!,My wifee LOVES IT!
R3OOGGQZ3AP4RE,This is a great quality product!!,I was very surprised by the size of the bottle when it arrived. it came sealed with the dropper in separate packaging. It is a very good quality Peppermint Oil as I've bought others in the past. Having the dropper makes it much easier when mixing with other things. I've created a muscle rub for sore muscles and it is very relaxing and soothing. I've also created  our own homemade mosquito spray....it's so nice not to smell like OFF! I'm amazed at how well it works. Peppermint Oil is also good to keep other bugs like ants and spiders at bay. I really like this product!<br />I have received this product at a  discounted price for my unbiased opinion.

The product left my scalp feeling very clean, my hair is shiny and soft and friends are coming up to me and asking if they can touch my hair, and exclaiming about how soft it is!  I highly recommend you purchase this shampoo and conditioner.  I would absolutely buy it again."
RS37IEN2DU3GA,Five Stars,"Great,"
R704YHQ4HUNPM,Great Brush,"My teeth instantly felt cleaner after the first use.  I have been impressed again and again by this product.  My family and I prefer the fact that it does not have a rechargeable battery, because the brush is mor powerful an takes up a lot less space in the bathroom.  (We use rechargeable AA's.). I really appreciate the two minute timer.  It sets a goal for cleanliness and if I don't feel like my teeth are clean enough at the end of it, I just push the button again!"

R2P3H71XB4MMRA,it cool or whatever,I like a lot. It works really well on my transitioning hair. I don't like the fact the have only used it twice and now I only have enough for about one more use. I have used a lot of 8oz deep conditioners that were a lot cheaper and it last me for months. But I does help my wrap come out good but I don't think I'll purchase this again

I seriously noticed a difference the very next morning after using this oil as my moisturizer the night before.  My skin had a more even tone, was supple and had a dewy look.  I don't think I will ever be without this product.  The communication from the seller (Frances) from the time I ordered until I received the product was great.

R2E8ZRFYGOIMEO,"Great, Excellent, and slightly noisy","This is a great trimmer. For me, who likes having a descent size beard length but occasionally trims, the variety of lengths are excellent. The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it makes alot of noise...trims well, but there is just a semi-loud noise. It isn't loud enough to return but I just want to let future customers know that it is kinda noisy."

R2JMZYUGJ5B5GR,Love the scent and how good my hair feels and looks,"Towards the middle of 2014, I started researching oils for skin, hair, to nails to see what they were all about because so many oils were being touted as the solution to all our beauty needs. As a kid, we all opened the Vitamin E capsules and they were always great with sunburns and so forth, but that was the extent of my knowledge. I then got into Coconut anything in my teens and moved on to Jojoba and Cocoa butters. The market is flooded with bringing back oils, which not too long ago was seen as a major no-no and especially for suffers of oily skin. I suffer from combination skin and this includes my scalp’s skin where I fluctuate with what the weather and seasons bring. One Winter I could have a normal scalp and the next Winter it could be dry, so it’s also skin with a temper and if you ask me, sort of moody. To squash the moodiness, I learned that simple is better when it comes to what I put on my skin and this includes my hair and scalp<br /><br />The conditioner smells a little stronge... Read more"

Further, the top was slightly ajar when it arrived and some of the contents spilled into the packagine.  The seller offered a 50% refund which I thought was very fair"

They come in a stylish roll out ivory bag with magnetic closing snaps to keep everything in its place. Disclosure: I received product(s) for free, in exchange for my honest review. I only recommend products I've used personally, and believe will be good fit for consumers."
R36SDZ3E5G4QX0,In the past the Doo Gro oil and hair ointments have worked great on my hair,"I purchased the Doo Gro Mega Thick Growth Lotion 12oz and lhave used it about three of times over the past week. I became a little concerned after the first application becuase I am natural (transitioned a year and a half ago) When I woke up the next morning it appeared to have impacted my hair texture (making look lcoarse, and kinky) from the usual curly, soft look.  So, I decided to online an look at others' reviews of the product before using it again.  In the past the Doo Gro oil and  hair ointments have worked great on my hair.  After reading the good reviews I decided to give it another try.  I am glad I did!  Wow! Although it does make your hair thicker, my soft and curly texture has not been altered.  I can see a great difference/restoration of hair  in areas of thinning and hair loss even. I also, can tell obvious growth of my hair that was been moderately to severely damaged at the hands of a hairstylist that  overly heated while processing my naturally soft and curly hair.  It has been a long road (8 months) to recovery.  So, using this product is likewalking into an overnight success story!  I  plan to continue using it to see what the end (results) will bring"

R175B1SE5GKCJR,Four Stars,"Sprayer needs to be fine a mist, but all in all, makeup stays.  Good stuff."
R8WU8PEZL9EK,Great compared to the manual ones,"Let me start by saying I exfoliate my feet everyday in the shower. There nothing worse than disgusting dry or cracked feet. So, preventatively I believe this is/should be part of daily bathing. Now, this is also my first electric scrubber/exfoliating callus remover. I use one of those handheld ones that looks like a small wooden paddle with emery boards on both sides. What I like about this is that it makes getting into hard to reach spots (like between toes or near nails) easier. The board I use will not get in these spots - but this will. I also like that this is water resistant. I took it in the shower right away (came charged) and used it UNDER water. No problems. I like that there are two speeds, but felt they could be slightly more powerful because when pressed against the foot (say a large area where you are inclined to put more pressure), it stops rotating - like it wasn't strong enough to keep spinning. Overall, I think this is a good product. I'd like a tiny bit more power, but overall I'm happy with it. With the extra replaceable head, I think I can even get my husband to use it - even if it is purple, glittery with flowers. Ha! It comes with a nice mesh bag, which everything even the charger fits into. Lastly, you'll notice there's a hole in the cap - which, I actually think this COULD work as a nail (or dog nails) sander/grinder. I received this as a sample, but all opinions are my own."
R307XWC3P7PMCR,Five Stars,I love this product. Been using for years.
R2AMVW94WKTXQQ,Detangles instantly,"This really works very well on my hair. I'm in transition from relaxer to to natural and the instant I put this on my hair, even before I start working it through my hair, it instantly detangles and smooths my hair so I can come through it easily. It doesn't require you to use alot of the conditioner for it to work. Just a small amount. I wish it was a little thicker though, its not even as thick as a regular conditioner.  It smells really good."

R2OS9E0366CVHT,Please be aware that this will do damage if it doesn't fit properly,"Be VERY cautious in using this as it misaligned my bite.  If the dental tray doesn't cover your back teeth, it will cause your teeth to move and can cause additional pain and problems.  It was too small for me.  If it covers your back teeth, I imagine it wouldn't be a problem.  Personally, I believe this product is too susceptible to user-error and is not a good idea to use.  It is a dangerous product.<br /><br />If you decide to use it, I recommend two things: 1. Make sure it covers your back teeth entirely when you wear it.  That will hold your bite together so it will not shift.  2. Be vigilant about any changes in your bite and stop using it immediately if you notice any changes.  You should be okay if you follow those two rules, but personally, I don't think it's worth the risk; it certainly was more trouble for me than it was worth."

R2JVK9JZU7W8UI,Not what I ordered,"I originally got Paris Fashion perfume as a gift from a friend and loved it. I didn't even know it was a Paris Hilton knock-off until I came on Amazon to buy a new bottle because my first one is running dangerously low. So I found what looked to be the correct item I was looking for, as per the image, and ordered it. When it arrived today I was highly disappointed when I opened the package. The first thing I noticed was the lid was not the one as advertised. The second thing I noticed was that the logo was not anywhere on the bottle itself. The third thing was the scent was not the same. It smells a teeny bit like my original bottle, but it is not the same. The fourth thing is that the design on the box is also not the same as the one that is shown for this product. Again, it is similar, but not exactly like the image on the product page. I am including a picture to go with this review.<br /><br />My original bottle (which already stated that I received from a friend) is on the left, and I have no box for it. However, the logo (Paris Fashion) is clearly visible.<br /><br />The item I received in the mail today is on the right side; no logo and different top. The box that is pictured came with the bottle I got today."

R17ARFSDV555EW,Better Than That Other Brush That Sells for $15,"**Update!! Counterfeit Item!!** After purchasing this brush and using it MAYBE 30 times over the past four months. It's been in my purse as just a backup brush and doesn't get used nearly as much as my other pink Wet Brush. As others have stated, this HAS to be a knock off. Attached are three photos. Notice how the yellow brush's bristles are gone or receded. I have had the pink Wet Brush for almost 9 months and have used it every single day with both wet and dry hair and it's not even close to as damaged as the yellow brush. Notice the difference also in the writing of the logo. Amazon needs to get these sellers off of here!   I bought this as a back up purse brush after buying the Crave Naturals detangling brush because I wasn't happy with the Crave brush. This brush can be used comfortably for left or right handed people. My Wet Brush is also made better in my opinion since the bristles don't warp and bend after a month of uses. I have super fine curly hair and My Wet Brush is amazing and getting all of the knots out after a shower. I highly recommend this brush and will be buying more just in case the one I have gets lost!"

R2RT1U6IM9BINX,"Good product, just not for people with sensitive teeth","I think this product is great for the average customer. Dont get me wrong, this isn't a review to bash crest or say I hate the product. I was super excited to get it and think it might make a difference. I am only giving it two stars because people with sensitive teeth do need to be aware that this toothpaste alone will make hell in your mouth. I used it every day for about a month before stopping since the warning said that the sensitivity would subside. However, it made it so bad that I couldnt brush my teeth without feeling like I was taking a knife to the most sensitive parts of my mouth. So I support this product, but people with naturally sensitive teeth need to find a different way to whiten. Unless you are willing to be in pain."
RDOQ9WRSOO57S,Not a perfect fit and VERY soft,"These fit OK but definitely leave a gap between the head and the handle.  They are significantly softer than the original heads, so much so that I've opted not to use them.  If you are looking for a very soft head, I suppose you would like these."

It,I bought my first Shiseido eyelash curler when I was in high school and used it for 4 years. It was time for a new one. I used to work in a makeup store and everyone always asked me what eyelash curler I used and this was the one I recommended. It will give you the perfect curl and is great for many different eye shapes (especially Asian). It will curl stubborn straight lashes.

R2WAI4TC4XU138,This perfume smells great!,"I was a little hesitant buying perfume online without smelling it first. I am so glad that I went ahead and made the purchase! Heartbreaker perfume has a strong scent , a woodsy smell but not overpowering at all. It only takes a couple of sprays and it lasts all day. I have recieved several compliments on it so far! I recieved this product at a discount for review but am satisfied with my purchase."
R30VPOIFMWMNQ7,Four Stars,Good deal on coconut oil. Great for using with essential oils. Received it in the mail fast.
RKBENENVWY9YQ,The BEST brush for knotty hair!!,"My only regret with this purchase is that I didnt do so sooner!  My 9 year old has very tanglely hair that practically gets matted.  Brushing her hair was a nightmare, especially since she is very tender-headed.  When I received this brush, she had 3 knots in her hair that our normal brush couldn't handle.  -It would just pull the hair out, or take forever to get the knot out, if it actually did.  All the while, my daughter is complaining that it &#34;hurts&#34;.  With the Michel Mercier brush, I had NONE of those problems.  My daughter never once flinched, which is nothing short of amazing, coming from a very tender-headed child.<br /><br />As for the knots, the &#34;bad&#34; ones took more time to manage, but it was 100 times easier than with a regular brush.  And, only a few strands of hair were in the bristles.  -Huge difference from what we're used to.<br /><br />Overall, HIGHLY recommend this brush!  I'm going to purchase a couple more of these, in case it's ever lost or breaks."

But it's orange.<br />It was really easy and quick to apply and I didn't even really try and it came out very even and streak free. It wasn't messy and it dries so quickly you don't even notice. It made my legs look nice except... It was definitely fake-tan orange colored. This would be 5 stars and I would buy tons of it if only the color was better. Maybe I will try the other &#34;light&#34; shade even though it has poor reviews. I think this one is too highly reviewed..

R2XQRFHEY55HN,"WILL BUY , AGAIN","Now ! I bought this soap after my sister mentioned trying black soap for her eczema . She loves beauty products that are not harsh at all. She loves it .. I tried it because of my acne and blemishes.I have been using it for 4 days now, and I'm really happy .. It does clear my acne breakouts that well , but it is getting rid / lightening my dark spots !! :) I'm getting away from using foundation because of this.<br /><br />Before this I wanted to try a fade lightening creme.. But I don't like moisturizing my body unless I'm leaving the house .. So I wanted a soap not a lotion or creme<br />The soap leaves your skin a bit dry , and leaves a little residue . I feel really clean after using it. I also had blemishes on my body , and I'm seeing it is helping lighten those , and also improve my skin tone all together. I don't mind my face being dry, because my face is really oil. Its not harsh to my skin and the smell is pleasant .. I love it, bought it for 1.99 at my local hair store. I will be trying the Raw black soap to see if the benefits increase,but I would also rack up on some more AMBI ."

I recently got butchered at the salon with many short, unmanageable layers so take that into consideration. I really wanted this to work but I think a more powerful wattage is what's needed for my unruly hair."

R3SPDKYT1OI0Y2,Amazing is the word for it.,"I never thought that there would be a good solution for seborrheic dermatitis. I've been to 2 dermatologists and a general practitioner, and was told the same thing, to use a steroid cream (prescription) and anti-fungal creams.. Yeah, sure it sorta worked, took about a week to clear up. Yet, lately my seborrheic dermatitis has been worse and none of the prescribed ointments were successful. So I reached out to Amazon Reviews and come upon this. Listen, there's some sort of magical witchcraft happening here cause it cleared up my skin in a weekend. After the first use, I was looking better. Here it is, day 3 and I'm completely cleared up. This stuff is amazing. I love it."

R2LF34ANKNCU02,Get rid of those stretch marks and scars,"My daughter was a little more rambunctious than my other kids, and the scar on her forehead just proves that. She had to have stitches and now has a scar on her face. I always worried for her, so I am always looking for a way to help fade it. I decided to give this one a try, while also using it on some stretchmarks on myself. The ingredients are all high quality and each have properties on their own to help, but together they make a great combo. I started out on her scar and so far, it already looks lighter and less prominent. My stretch marks seem more hydrated and look better than they did before. The cream is lighter than I expected, not heavy and sticky like another I tried. It is effective in even a short amount of time, I can't wait to see what it does in 4 or 6 weeks. I highly recommend. I have already told my friends about it, I know plenty of people who need help.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

I did not expect to see such a dramatic improvement from the emery boards I've used previously, but the edges are silky smooth after I file them with these.<br /><br />I have used these wet or dry and have gotten good results both ways.  Much less effort to file than with an emery board.

R1Y0BDSOTNQTHX,"Win, win win!","I really like this product, it's in a cute little circular bottle and feels refreshing yet soothing! It has a lovely citrus aroma and feels light and airy on my skin. It shipped and arrived very quickly and I immediately tried it when I opened it up. Its too early for me to offer a long term review however, for a day cream, it seems perfect - light, non-greasy, moisturizing and anti-aging. Win, win, win...plus it's from Finland too so that's even better!"
R12OY9EMBYYRL5,Great product.,"This stuff works great.  It's effective, but doesn't feel like it's bad for my nails.  It works really quickly."
R1T65JK2XXQLDL,Terrible,It is awful. It smells like paint. The fact it's a glitter oil must have turned it rancid. Not what I was hoping for at all.

R3QRH2XEM105D9,Good Product,"It is a  decent  product.  It is over the counter- you can buy it in many shops. I  had my teenage son wash with it  many  months,  and it seemed to help  his acne.  I  see the difference  between  using  it  and  not  using  it  -  since  my  son  has  not  been  using  it  for  the  past  5  months.<br />Without  using  this  product,  there are  more  pimples.  The soap made by the same company  does not work as well as this.  I  also used the sulfur clay masks by Peter Thomas Roth - keep on for 5 hours.  ( you can use them as spot treatments also)"

R15948JDQ0HL6R,A light non-aerosol hairspray with good holding power,"I don't know why I did not (immediately) realize this was hair spray.  I is non-aerosol, and lighter than most, but hairspray it is.<br /><br />I tried it because I have used products with kelp which were very nice, left my hair feeling soft.  The Tresemme spray left it slightly tacky and stiff, not as sticky or stiff as mainstream harsprays, but still, some of that.  I have very fine straight hair and have to say that it holds very well.  I wike up with a curl on the end of my hair even though I had washed it off (not with shampoo, just rinsed in the sink) which does tell me that you've got to shampoo to get it out.<br /><br />The rfagrenxce is fruity and reminds me of (the old version of) &#34;Herbal Essence&#34; shampoo (not the original, which was grassy, herbal, nor the new which is lightly minty) but the formul which they used for many years that smelled fruity.  It also reminds me of some of the Body Shop's shower gels, also fruity and clearly aimed at teenagers.  I am guessing I am the wrong audience for this. I do not use hair spray and  do not like to ssmell like fruit.  There are a number of Tresemme  products which I have liked, but this one is nt for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />good holding power even on fine hair<br />lighter and less sticky than most hair sprays<br /><br />Cons:<br />leaves your hair somewhat stif and slightly sticky<br />Has a sweet fruity smell similar to products marketed towards teenages (this may be a pr4o or con depending on whether you like sweet fruity smells)"
R3W4GGGUT6AR3O,Five Stars,Great to use on the face! Doesn't run sunscreen in my eyes.
R24V5Y9I6ZSBSJ,Five Stars,I liked it very much. Gives my lashes much more length when applying mascara.
R35LS88SM1LI5F,Good Moisturizer in a set with the cleanser it is even better!,"Bought two things as a set - The cleanser and the moisturizer, so as the set it is good for your skin and it feels like it is doing a great job.  I have hyoung skin still, but I am trying to make sure as I get older it doesnt sag or wrinkle and you cant go backwards to fix damage .. so you must be aware and prevent it going forward.  I feel like this is working and I like the smells and the feels.  It is not too thick or coarse or thin and watery.  It is a good consistency and feels like it has enough oil to help with out being greasy.  I did receive this item at a promotional value price in exchange for my honest opinion and review unbiased from any seller discounts given to me."
R36VNNQ6MDCK83,Great stuff!,"This absolutely makes my skin feel smooth.  I think it is a great base for foundation.  I need to partner this with other ROC products and get the best outcome possible.  This goes on smooth, it is a gray color, but it doesn't turn your skin any color.  It gives you a nice matte finish to your complexion."

R377H204FMEP1V,Proof it's real!,"Love this product! The hair is real regardless of those who say its not. I curled all of it at 400 degrees and its just fine. It sheds when you first pull the hair out of the package but after you brush it once it doesn't shed much at all. I don't know about the other colors but this one is perfect. I wish it had a bit less of the blonde and more of the other color, but it still blends nice. I took a pic of the hair before and after i curled it. Hope this helps resolve any questions you had on whether it is real or not."
R2SHW83MYIKTQ6,I did not like the texture nor the mint add on,"This was not for me.<br />I did not like the texture nor the mint add on. If I knew there is mint inside I would not buy it , but since I did not know I had to find out  in the hard way (My pocket mainly)"

RBE0S2UR2VHR7,I love it!,"I’ve never had an electric toothbrush before and I’m impressed.  I didn’t know if I would like it or not and how awkward it would be to brush my teeth this way.<br /><br />This is fast and easy and does a great job.  My teeth feel very clean and are white despite the amount of coffee I drink.  The factory presets the toothbrush to stay on for a full two minutes before it turns itself off.  This is the recommended time by dentists.  I’ve always brushed my teeth for a while, but never quite this long.  I like the fact it keeps track for you.<br /><br />The instructions also say to split your mouth in quadrants for brushing,  I’ve never heard the prompting sound to move to another section of my mouth because I’m partially deaf, but it still works just fine and I’ve never run out of time before I’ve brushed my whole mouth.<br /><br />Taking care of your teeth is so important and now it’s easier than ever.  I can say so many good things about this toothbrush.<br /><br />The unit itself looks great.  It’s sleek, compact and white.<br />It has three speed settings for brushing.<br />It has the built-in timer.<br />There’s a clean function and a white and polish function.<br />It comes with a nice case so you can take it when traveling.<br />It’s very quiet while running.  You won’t disturb anyone else using it.<br />The brush is small and the unit is lightweight but well made.<br />It has a two-year warranty with an extra-added six months if you register it online.<br /><br />I’m awed with how good this works and can’t imagine using my regular, manual toothbrush again.  I leave the unit plugged in all the time so it’s ready to go, but the manufacturer says a charge will last up to three weeks.  I’ve never tried this.<br /><br />I highly recommend this toothbrush."
R2ENVPJGXRRTQ0,good for the price.,Over all happy. Half the polish remover pens were empty. I just dip and swipe.. Works..
R19HRVCCGVSN5J,Perfect sunscreen,"Works perfectly! Not too difficult to rub in and doesn't leave white residue like other sunscreen. And it keeps us protected. I've used it on adults, babies and toddlers."
R4SO9PW9KMOLZ,Love this product,"Love this product! As someone with very thin hair who get's their hair bleached blonde regularly, this product has helped my hair go from breaking off every time I brush it, to actually growing somewhat considerably. It's a regular in my daily getting ready routine post shower."

R2Q6738SXN8V0B,Easy system,"I love this system. I recieved this free to try from BzzAgent an incredible app!

Its really great amazing results!"

R2WX0315V096TK,Wonderful,Best shampoo ever. I'm allergic to almost everything and this shampoo actually soothes my scalp rather than breaking me out! It's an added bonus that I'm constantly complimented on how shiny my hair is!
R1D0WUWOJUOXRX,Nice smell...but,"Doesn't work, but it smells nice. I brought it for my underarm. It seems to actually getting darker."
R39UQS0V9VP738,Smells great!,"I initially liked it because it smelled great, but learned that it's also better for you because it doesn't contain harmful chemicals. I love the lavender and vanilla scent that stays on your hands after washing. You pay more for it but it's worth it."
R3LQA67H6BXRDS,Works wonders,I received this product as a sample in my Ipsy glam bag and it worked wonders so i ordered the larger size from Amazon. It made my hair so soft and i could really tell a difference in my split ends almost immediately.

R1UX0PEXRWL236,I ended up getting 2 so thats cool. I've never had high end eye-shadow except some ...,"I was hesitant to buy this because of the mixed reviews but was tempted by the low price here on Amazon. I ended up getting 2 so thats cool. I've never had high end eye-shadow except some Clinique I was gifted so I can't compare it in that aspect, but the pigmentation on these is less than the Coloricon by WetnWild. All the shades are usable on me except one, the highlight from the second quad (third from the top row left to right). It's almost the same as my skin tone and dissapears. I think overall this is lacking in highlight shades. Technically there should be 3 ( one per quad) but only the top left is light enough for my skin tone. The highlight for the right quad is beautiful but a medium tone on me that works more as a lid color.  Because of that the concept of these being arranged as quads doesn't work for me. I find myself reaching for an additional highlight eyeshadow to complete a look. But I'm still happy with this and it offers something I didn't have in my collection. If you already own eye-shadow you love in gold, browns and neutrals this might not be for you."

RH3OAVL7V1L35,"Good, clean shave at a great price","My husband tried this razor out and was expecting that, at the price, it would be acceptable.  What he discovered is that it was much better than that and provided a clean, close shave.  It was close to but not quite as good as the pricey Norelco razor that I bought him a few years ago.  On the other hand, this razor was considerably less expensive and works well for him otherwise.  He also tells me that it comes close in quality to a shave with a straight edge at the barber."

RQH2JTXYI5SPE,Four Stars,It has a great smell and goes on very thick!!
RHXRTVH95WWIT,I would highly recommend!,"I was surprised at how much I really liked this stuff!! I use plain coconut oil already for my hair and skin (just a large tub of organic oil I got from the grocery) and I love it. But I think I like this stuff much better.<br /><br />The down side is it's more expensive. But the plus side does make up for it. To start, the coconut scent is not nearly as strong with this product. Now I don't mind the smell of coconut at all, but that doesn't necessary mean I want to walk around smelling like it all the time. This oil is a lot more subtle. Another great thing is that it is already liquid so its a bit easier to work with, as opposed to what I have from the grocery that I have to warm up a bit to melt.<br /><br />I have been using this on my legs and they feel fantastic. It is especially great after shaving and it seems to help a lot with razor burn and bumps. I also used it as a hair mask and it worked wonderfully.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

I can use it twice a day and feel it has improved the appearance of my skin, both reducing fine lines and evening out my skin tone.  I just ordered another bottle to avoid running out!  I have been satisfied with a few other products from Instanatural as well.

It leaves my hair with an additional shine I wouldn't get from my typical shampoo or conditioner. It even smells great too. My hair is really looking so I have to use a quarter sized amount instead of the dime sized in my hand. For best results, make sure you apply it to your hair while it is still damp from your shower.

RVH2PNHAEH61,A little goes a long way for firm younger skin,"I notice a firming and uplifting effect right away. I use this twice a day and have seen some cumulative improvements. This serum has noticeably smoothed and plumped the fine lines underneath the outer corners of my eyes and used in conjunction with your moisturizer you will seriously take years off your face. My face is softer, smoother and more radiant... Someone recently told me that my face was glowing! it absorbs very quickly and doesn't cause breakouts. I also appreciate that a very small amount goes a long way, and I found that after using it for a few weeks, the serum leaves skin even-toned, smooth and clear.<br /><br />I do have bee sting allergies so I tested on a miniscule spot on my wrist over a few days and didn't have a problem so I went ahead and used it on my face. I use only a tiny bit (which is all you need) so this bottle will last me forever. I'm really happy with the skin firming results, it really has made a big difference in the tightness of my skin. Just because I'm 43 doesn't mean I have to look it!<br /><br />In the photo I am not wearing any foundation, just a tinted moisturizer over this serum- this was taken after roughly a month of using the serum.<br /><br />I received a sample or discount in exchange for my honest review.

R2U9DO5G486A26,i like it,"Everyone who wears falsies needs this tool, especially if you are a beginner like me. It doesn't get it as close to the eyelash line as I would like, but thats probably user error rather than problem with the tool. I use it to get the false eyelashes over my real ones, then use tweezers to apply close to the lash line, then use this again to secure lashes in place. I could probably just use my fingers and tweezers to get job done, but i find that when I use these, I get a more real look with lashes."

RL48IO7Z8NBPW,so the right clipper is something I am somewhat mindful of) but this item left me sorely disappointed. The clipper is too small,"I'm a huge fan of Trim brand clippers (I have 5 young kids and one of my household duties is keeping all 100 of their finger/toe nails groomed. Add in my 20 and that is 120 nails to manage, so the right clipper is something I am somewhat mindful of) but this item left me sorely disappointed. The clipper is too small. It is difficult to use. I am a 5'9&#34; man of average build so it's not like I am a large man with Russel Wilson hands. I'd like for the clipper to be a little longer.<br /><br />Second, the pointy end on the lever opposite the clippers makes using the tool very uncomfortable. After a couple dozen nails my fingers are uncomfortable. I've had other Trim cippers that were more comfortable to use-longer and flat not pointy lever end. Unfortunately those were misplaced (probably by one of my children). I want to find that same model/type.<br /><br />I'd argue this would be a good clipper for a child to use. When my children are older it will probably be a good clipper for them but in the mean time I will not be using these. Time to go shopping for a better model."

RJOO4BE2DSN1V,Amazing for the MOST STUBBORN LASHES,"AH-MAZZING!  My eyelashes are stubborn and HATE to curl.  The only way they would stay curled is if I heated my eyelash curler with my blow dryer, immediately curled them and put on waterproof mascara righhhhtt after. I have tried various heated lash curlers but none heated hot enough or the design worked well enough. After much hesitation of spending money again on another heated eyelash curler, I decided to get it and I haven't resorted back to my good ole Shu Uemura and blow dryer. I love this thing and am so glad I found it.  I have curled it the right before bed and have woken up to them still curled! I wish I would post a picture!"

I use it 3x a week in place of regular toothpaste.<br />It is a powder, that you mix with a little water ( I just pour the powder into the palm of my hand, and add some water).  It works really well to eliminate plaque accumulation in or at the gum line.<br /><br />I use it to clean my tongue, as well.  After I mix the powder with water, I just put the mixture all over my tongue brush."
R11RFI8RQJXNX2,Best Daily Facial Lotion With Natural SPF,"I bought this product at Whole Foods for a great price!  I suffer from rosacea/eczema and have extremely sensitive skin.  I have tried a MULTITUDE of facial skin lotions with SPF, including the expensive high-end brands.  This is the BEST facial lotion I have ever purchased!  Yes, I would consider it a moisturizer with a sunscreen because it contains titanium dioxide, a natural SPF, and coconut, a natural moisturizer.  It goes on smoothly and after application, my skin feels smooth and silky, as opposed to the other lotions with SPF that made my skin feel heavy, greasy and slick.  I highly recommend this lotion for people with sensitive skin!!!  :)"
R3LKXZMVH8V787,Five Stars,Absolutely fantastic!!
R74EOFP8O2JWL,Quality Product,"Underwear are of very high quality and are very affordable. Size seems to run a little bit smaller than average. Workmanship is very good, front pouch is rather small,  waistbands are like those found on high end products. Best thing about these underwear is the bamboo fiber they are made of, which seems to be stronger than cotton, is more stretchy and less bulky."
RJ25SNZ2WBXUZ,"Great, affordable product","I have been using Crest 3d products for about two years, pretty much tried most of them from the expensive ones to these, very affordable tooth pastes. This one does the job well and i keep going back to it, is great for sensitive teeth and gums and in my opinion it works just as well as the more expensive Crest products that come in smaller tubes. I drink soda (Diet Coke) every day and coffee about twice a week, this definitely keeps my teeth from getting super yellow like they used to before i started with Crest. I will be completely honest, it doesnt actually whiten my teeth, but no toothpaste does. I use it to keep my teeth from getting worse while i drink so much soda that makes teeth stain.. The perfect combination is using this twice a day and Crest whitening strips every couple of months, the combination keeps my teeth white no matter what i drink or eat :)"

R3G9D8RLGX9G7R,Wonderful golden amber slightly thicker oil. I love it!,"Morning Pep Rosehip Oil is packaged in a 4 ounce dark brown glass bottle with optional dropper top. The smell to me is &#34;rosehip oil&#34;, a little nutty maybe, nice, light, doesn't linger long. Morning Pep rosehip oil is a rich amber in color and a touch thicker than other's. I use rosehip oil in skin care and hair care. I make my own flaxseed hair gel for extremely curly hair so I mix rosehip, argan and ylang ylang in it. This oil worked wonderful for my gel. I also mix rosehip oil in with my conditioner's. This oil works great a s cuticle oil also, I use it every day. For a facial oil, I mix rosehip and coconut oil 50/50 and add a few drops of frankincense EO and use it around eyes and lips for fine lines. This oil is as good as about any serum out there for moisture to use at night. This oil absorbs in your skin very quickly also. I love this oil, the color and thickness of it and will buy again.  Ingredient list off bottle:100% Natural Rose Hip Oil, cold pressed from Rose Hip. This oil is a great bargain, very high quality and works as well or better then brand costing much more. It also has many other uses.  Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. However your own opinion might vary.

RW3Z5QKVKLERB,Excellent hydrating moisturizer,"I love this moisturizer, and I use it every night before bed.

R1AIJK0JG8QHRJ,Not really sure...,"I had taken the advice from another reviewer to put this on my clothes instead of my skin to repel Mosquitos. It's hard to tell if I didn't get bit because of the oil, or a mix from my bonfire and the weather getting cooler at night. I'm going to keep my eye out for a diffuser, I read that peppermint decreases your appetite so I'm extremely curious to see if it works!"

R27JGMXFCA8GXU,Works like magic...seriously.,"My feet have a tendency to get calloused, and it's pretty difficult to get rid of the dead skin that develops on the heels. Scrubs are great for light exfoliation, but anyone with dry, cracked heels will tell you that even the most luxurious scrubs do nothing in that department. I was skeptical when I ordered Baby Foot, but the slew of good reviews on Amazon - as well as a few on Buzzfeed - prompted me to give it a whirl. At only $20 bucks, I figured it wasn't that much of a risk. Boy am I glad I tried it! Read on...<br /><br />About a week ago,  I used the product. I followed the instructions and cleaned/soaked my feet beforehand, and then slipped on the booties (the smell is pretty wonderful). I put socks over those and watched TV for the next hour (warning: don't walk around while wearing the booties, as you might slip and injure yourself). After sitting still for exactly one hour, I rinsed the gel-like residue from my feet and went on with my life.<br /><br />Over the next few days, nothing miraculous occurred. My feet were still dry, chapped, and gross. Exactly six days after my &#34;treatment&#34;, I decided to soak my feet in some warm water (peeling occurs within 5-7 days, and I hoped this would help facilitate the peeling process). I filled a foot bath with hot water and Epsom salts and relaxed for an hour. I was not prepared for what I saw when I took my feet out of the water...<br /><br />SKIN. Chunks of rubbery, white, dead skin were hanging off my feet. It didn't hurt at all, and as I excitedly pulled away the dead layers (much like a child ripping the paper off a Christmas package), I saw healthy, new skin beneath. It was a miracle! I almost had a heart attack, but in a happy way.<br /><br />Sometimes, beauty treatments can be gross before they work. My feet are still peeling a bit, but I am hooked. This method is so much easier than furiously scrubbing at your dead skin with a Ped Egg, or some other exfoliator. Just make sure you follow the instructions, and 5-7 days after the treatment, soak your feet thoroughly. You won't be disappointed.ak your feet thoroughly. You won't be disappointed."

R3460RC11HENX,came as a beige,well I planned on getting pink because of team colors and it came beige and it says &#34;color is readom&#34; which I don't know if they meant random but im very disappointed.
RLGXWTR56JBHQ,"Works great on coarse, dry hair","This intense restoration mask appears to work well on coarse, dry hair. I use it together with the [[ASIN:B00R0UK8AA Dove Advanced Hair Series Ultra Nourishing Shampoo]] and [[ASIN:B00R0UK878 Dove Advanced Hair Series Ultra Nourishing Conditioner]]. It is a light, moist looking cream that is easy to work into the hair. I let it on longer than needed. It seems to do a decent job of leaving my dry and slightly damaged hair soft and manageable. However, it's hard to determine its effectiveness on its own since I did use it with the other matching products in the Advanced Hair Series Quench Absolute line. It is scented, sort of a chemical like fragrance that I don't care much for."

RA298149UHSJ0,It gives me the perfect bronze without that extream orange look,The ONLY tanning lotion I will use. It gives me the perfect bronze without that extream orange look. My biggest reason for loving this lotion is the pleasant tropical smell. Almost all tanning lotions are way to strong on the perfume side. This lotion is perfect for me.

R1WU5JZD2BXBPO,"Beautiful, flattering color.","Very cute color! Not too shimmery and the applicator size (which is pretty small) actually works quite well. You can layer the blush for a stronger look and I feel like because of that it would work on most skin tones. I normally have pretty light skin but during the summer now I am more tan, but this blush still looks great. The color makes me feel like a doll! I am very happy with this blush."

I've gotten into the habit of putting on a night cream (I use Andalou products) and putting the seriously firming serum just around my lips, eyes and neck. This keeps my pillowcase a little less oily. I do notice results using this. It does firm, but I notice it diminishing fine lines more."

R1PUR8CZ9LKO71,Acne prone sensitive skin,"Its been two days & my skin has never felt like this with a moisterizer. I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin.

R15LTNEJCCIPXZ,Five Stars,Love the colour so much.
R146JTHNCFCI72,Rescue for Frizzy or damaged hair,"I love this product, it's not heavy on the hair. Any one with a frizz problem, curly or damaged hair will be so happy with the results. You only use a VERY small amount so the 1.6 oz should last a year. My hobby is synchronized swimming, and I color my hair, so the swimming leaves my hair so dry and my ends very damaged, but I love to keep my hair below shoulder length. SO I would say this product saves my hair. I apply it generously before swimming for protection. After I wash my hair I apply just a tiny amount to my dry ends and they look healthy. This vendor offers a great price. I opted to buy theirs even though they charge for shipping, because even with the shipping it was cheaper than the prime price."

R3R3JDQCO547BO,Can't find these in stores anymore,"I've been using a Trac II razor since I started shaving 35 years ago. The name brand blades used to give a closer, smoother shave, and last longer than generic blades but that no longer seems to be the case. The generic blades are just as good. Lately, I haven't been able to find them in stores and I'm not paying $17 for a package of ten Gillette blades. When I saw these on Amazon I figured I couldn't go wrong - 100 blades for the price of 10. They arrived three days after I ordered them and are as good as anything I've found at the store. I will definitely order again."

R1NG0S1XXE69HX,Amazing case and beautiful brushes,"I mainly got this for the case. I love having a cylinder brush case and my old one wore out on me after 6 years!

R2DCVGV5ZVA631,I don't really like the feeling that cold,"I received a tester of this product for free via BzzAgent. I had used a type of Secret clear gel in the past and have since switched to a solid. I don't really like the feeling that cold, wet, gel gives me.<br /><br />This particular one seemed like it took forever to dry and got on my t-shirts. It seemed to discolor the armpits of a few of my t-shirts. I had to walk around with my arms in the air for a few minutes before getting dressed to avoid this.<br /><br />I really put it to the test the day I had my military range fire. I live in a hot, humid area so I figured I would see how long it really lasted. After about an hour out in the heat I felt like I needed to re-apply. The scent was long gone, and I didn't feel like it was offering any protection. By lunchtime I had put my old deodorant back on. I wish I could say it passed the test... but it didn't even come close."

RO6YAJRDIR235,This is a good hyaluronic acid serum.,"This Hyaluronic serum is velvety smooth and absorbs immediately.  No grease or cream, just a wonderful absorbing liquid that makes your face feel so good and smooth.  I love using Hyaluronic serum and this one is very nice.  It doesn't have a strong scent and has a dropper to easily get just enough product to (one drop) to cover your entire face and neck.  I was given this product to try to give and honest opinion. I do recommend it."
R1SQ8MFYDK91GE,They look great.,Simple system as far as I’m concerned and the whitening works wonders on my teeth. They look great.

REASW41O745SN,This is my favorite cleanser of all time,"This is my favorite cleanser of all time.<br />The first time I tried it, I bought it from a physical Skinfood store. I couldn't wait to use it and I could notice results after the first wash.<br /><br />The bottle I got was actually bigger than the original one I bought. It was a different packaging as well.<br />When I tried it, I didn't like it as much as the original. It still works, but the smell is weaker and it feels like there's less tea tree oil in it. It doesn't work as well as the one first bought.<br /><br />It still works, but not as well. However, I'm sure that's because my skin is better than before :)<br />I will continue to buy this, but maybe from the store from now on."

I have naturally thin hair so this made me look like I had even less hair.<br />It recovered over time so I stopped worrying as much. I DID get some bald spots, but they went away when I used the right shampoo and a hair spray that I got from Skinfood.<br /><br />I really liked the results, but I don't think I will dye my hair again until it's healthier or back to being all black. I think it looks better with time, depending on how you cut your hair or style it.<br /><br />I would recommend this to girls with thicker hair. You might need more than one box though."

I had a high hopes for this product and wanted to use it for the whole month before my wedding to improve my skin. My main concern is a dullness and melasma so after the whole 30 days I can say that my skin looks brighter and firmer. I use the serum at night time before my night cream and I will continue to use it since t I can see some dramatic improvement in my skin quality.

It recently showed up on his face in large welts. We have tried a lot of products throughout the years with no success unless we had a prescription for cortisone cream. Because of the harsh chemicals in the prescription cream I wanted him to have something natural. That is when I came across this product. It has been a miracle cream for my son. It doesn't burn, leave a greasy residue, or have harsh chemicals. He has been using it twice a day and that has been enough to keep the large red patches of eczema away. Thank you so much for making this product! I have told others about it that have children with eczema."

RYWUJT2A33VJH,Her surgery was amazing. I thought about going to a different plastic ...,"I have had my Opal for 4 years.  4 years ago I had bags under my eyes (I was 44) I went to a plastic surgeon and he was honest enough to tell me to come back when I was 50.  The lady I worked with kept pointing the sagging skin under my eyes.  She had surgery under her eyes and tried to get me to do the same.  Her surgery was amazing.  I thought about going to a different plastic surgeon, but after hearing that it was $3000 dollars to do the surgery I opted for the Opal. I bought it at a high end salon for $199.00  It took almost a YEAR of use before really seeing a noticeable difference.  I use it everyday.  4 years later my eyes are tight, firm and people cannot believe I am 48.  Most people tell me I look like I am in my 30's.  This product takes a long time to see results.  The more you use it the better.  I think what really works is the massage you get under your eyes more than the product penetration.  I think the vibrations break up the fatty tissue under the eyes, but this takes a very long time to work.  The Dr. I visited explained that the surgery will suck out the fatty tissue that causes the bags, but then some people end up with a hollow look under their eyes which is very displeasing.  So why not take the time to use the product and get rid of the fatty tissue slowly.  NOTHING except plastic surgery will work immediately.  It took years to build up the fatty tissue, so it will take a long time to get rid of it.  Also, the first one I bought would not recharge.  Clarisonic WILL send you a new one.  I went through 3 before I realized I was not charging it right.  You have to line up the silver with the silver when recharging and make sure it does not move while recharging.  After returning 3 devices, I finally figured out how to charge properly.  My current device has been with me for 2.5 years and is my best friend.  I skip some beauty routines, but NEVER my Opal.  Just give it time, time, time........"
R2J7BT43I71ZMN,Add Shine & Softness,"Tresemme is a product that has a good reputation.  This conditioner is designed to restore older, damaged, dry hair.  It has a pleasing smell that is not overpowering or too perfumery.  It does provide softness and shine after using.  After use I did need texturizing spray to give my hair lift to style.<br /><br />Tresemme Conditioner Youth Boost is designed to be used in conjunction with Tresemme Shampoo Youth Boost and their other Youth Boost products to receive the full benefits of the “Youth Boost”."

R3LMNNBM9SBS79,Great Product,It's helped my skin look and feel smoother. I'm on my third bottle and will continue to purchase it. It's helped reduce my adult acne. My skin definitely isn't breaking out as much and the hyperpigmentation I would get from the occasional cyst is virtually nonexistent. Turn around time on those has been reduce to half.
R1JC6IC9AVCN7I,Great price on this product,Great price on this product. I have seen so many other whitening products go for twice this or three times even. And it’s a bargain. I have personally used this product and can vouch for how the tray system is pretty decent and a more convenient way. My teeth look great and at a good price too.
R1BO0FXTEYV0X5,Expected more from the wet shave but this was not very good either. If you are seeking a close shave ...,Did  not give a close shave. Expected more from the wet shave but this was not very good either. If you are seeking a close shave buy another razor.
R3U8PCKXDG3E4L,Stressed Perfume,"Well, the strangest thing happened with this product.  I had gotten a sample of this perfume somewhere and just loved it.  My skin did, too! So I decided to order it on Amazon.  This bottle smells totally different from the sample.  It's not that it smells old or out of date just different.  What a mystery!  Maybe my skin changed!"
R1KI5KAOSDKEZQ,This is a awesome product,My husband was in a bad accident and he has been using this to ease some of the pain in his leg.  He said he can feel the pain just going away almost as soon as he rubs it in - he mixes a few drops in a couple of ounces of coconut oil.  It compares with other products from MLM companies that are much more expensive.  Why pay for commission upon commission upon commission when you can get a great product at a reasonable price?
R2TE0WHE2PHWRL,Five Stars,Product met expectations.
R2TGXYY9VHQ7XI,I really wanted to love them but...,"The band is thick and if you have sensitive eyes, the band will start to itch by the middle of the day. Its a great amount of eyelashes, at a great price, but you know what they say about things being too good to be true! If you don't have sensitive eyes, or you have the time to wash and mess with the band to make it less stiff then its a good buy. I wear them, however, its every now and again. I would definitely try to find something similar elsewhere."
R1X343U63V7F9M,Soft and pretty. Color matched,Soft and pretty. Color matched. But I ordered two packages and it still is too thin to be believable. And I have average thickness. It gets really thin and scrappy at ends so it thickens up your hair in top then thins out real bad at bottom :( waste of 50+ dollars. May go buy matching wefts at sallys and sew them in to remedy.
R2EGVAL8XESNAG,No seal on product.,"I was disappointed because there was no seal on the product when I received it. It is odorless and feels good on my fingertips, however I am afraid to use it and leave on my skin due to there being no seal on it. Also, it is clear and rose hip should be reddish orange if it is cold pressed and has not been through a bleaching process."
R2UVXMWOX1AKWZ,"French Lavender provokes nausea, Honey Mango is great","Cleans good and leaves skin moisturized unlike bar soaps. The French lavender scent is a little much for me, I prefer the Mango Honey. It smells much better to me. It lasts me a good while because you only need a few pumps per shower session."
R20U9QIWVLEAJG,Everyday use,"I use this coconut oil for just about everything. I know it can be used for cooking, but I use it as an everyday moisturizer (great for a growing baby bump,) a face cleansing treatment, an all natural deodorant, make up remover, hair flyaway tamer, and cuticle oil. It has so many uses. I definitely recommend it."
R12YOP0B139RNC,My son loves the Face Balm! I love the company restoration plan!,"I got this face balm for myself to try on facial skin blemishes, but the odor is too strong for my liking. It did feel good as I applied it and a little bit went a long way. Because of the more &#34;male&#34; odor, I asked my son to try it.  Unlike me, he thought it was a pleasant, male odor, but that didn't matter because it faded quickly. He reported that it only took one squirt from the pump bottle to cover the &#34;shaved&#34; area of his face and that it felt good and refreshing.  I'm not taking off a star just because i don't like the fragrance... That doesn't matter since it fades quickly. Besides I admire the Thrive company plan of land restoration instilled in its formation. For more about that, read the Amazon catalog page.  Highly recommended, but mostly for men.

R2W0CLCE8YVO7U,but for the price I was more than satisfied. I forced a part into it,"Bought this for a Peggy Carter cosplay for BCC. It came two weeks earlier than expected, which made it in time for the con (my expected delivery date was August 5; I left for the con on the 31st). It's a little on the thin side, but for the price I was more than satisfied. I forced a part into it, which made my hair show through, but as it was the same color as the wig no one noticed."
R1VEWCCX279MCP,I absolutely love this product,"I absolutely love this product. I bought it because I had used the dry oil from this brand and liked the results, so I thought I'd give this a shot. At first I was hesitant because it is a thicker oil than the dry oil, but my fears were quickly allayed when I realised that it didn't weight my hair down or make it excessively more oily than regular. I spray a tiny bit of it on my wet hair after I get out of the shower, and then again after it's become just damp and I'm beginning to style it. I'm not sure if it's managed to create any long term benefits, but it definitely works at protecting my hair from combing and styling, and with curly, prone-to-knotting hair, that's all I can ask."

I hope BullFrog will continue with this first step and bring back the old gel!<br />The picture is what the old bottles looked like."

I love using this for the natural non-nasty ingredients.  Have been using it for a few weeks and have not had one day of odor when using just this for my deodorant. Definitely recommended!
RKI2WFIQPOUWO,"this straightener is great, my hair looks perfect","i am 28 years old and have never had a hair straightener. this straightener is great, my hair looks perfect. and i love the argon oil. so happy i made the jump - previously i was just using a curling iron to straighten my hair. woo hoo!"
R1VS6BK9U9U27L,Great for thin curly hair,I have thin curly hair that tends to be frizzy if not conditioned properly.  This product has been a game changer.  Spray a small amount on damp hair & scrunch it in a bit.  I then let it air dry & my curls are more defined.

I was excited to try it since after listening to two of the top skin Doctors in NY that you really only need two things for great skin Vit C 20% and Vit A.  I love this product my skin is glowing and that hasn't happened in years.  A Friend asked why my skin looked so great so I had to share and she has now ordered the Vit C.  Don't worry about the smell of the Vit C since as soon as it hits your skin it has no odor at all and really makes you glow.  Love the Protege line!!!

R2N86FLQ7W7HRI,I was using this shampoo before and didn't love it because no lather,"I was using this shampoo before and didn't love it because no lather. Also the lid broke which was a pain. After using other swim shampoos, I'm back to Aubrey because it makes my hair so soft and not like straw like the other shampoos. It doesn't lather, but I sometimes use my regular shampoo after the Aubrey then finish it off with the Aubrey conditioner"
RGS9AFR6ARDDV,Good spray bottle,Nice little spray bottle.  Durable.  I put cologne in it for the gym and travel back and work quite well.  Also used it to mist our face by the pool.  Spray is consistent and even.  That is not always the case

RLKJC48EURYW5,Five Stars,I actually really like this wig its and a nice length
R10QZEV9M4HFQL,I love this product,"I love this product!  It is extremely lightweight to the point of a water-type gel consistancy. I have never experienced a moisturizer like this before that was so lightweight but so hydrating.  This is suitable enough for me to use morning and night (although I do pair a heavier cream ontop of this at night before I sleep) and I have experienced absolutly no breakouts using this product. Moistrizers are very hard for me to find with my picky and stubborn acne prone combo-oily skin. This is definitly a HG product for me.  This product does contain fragrance, but I find that it disappears quickly after application.  The only sugguestion I have for this product is that I believe it would be better packaged in a squeez or pump tube. I find that is is very easy to get too much product in a jar, and I also have sanitation issues in mind.  Edit: 12/30/15  Contamination has been an issue with this product. Where it is in a tub it has slowly, over the last several months, become contaminated. I believe this is the cause of a major forehead breakout I recently experienced!  Even using a spatula, this could not be avoided.  This really could be a great product, but oh how I wish they had it in a pump bottle!"
R27PSZ2WQC8BKM,:(,didn't work for me
R1D7JH1ARE8SNS,Great Product,I have been using this moisturizer for about two months and it is great. I put it on in the morning under my makeup (including a BB Cream with SPF 30). I tend to have easily irritated and dry skin and this moisturizer was gentle enough to avoid any irritation and it provided enough moisture. I have also noticed that the texture of my skin looks a lot better and my acne seems to be clearing up.

RE91SP6YOL081,Five Stars,Keeps my hair moisturizer and soft
R2JKEAWQPVMPVJ,Doesn't dry out your skin,"Dove has long been a favorite of consumer magazines because of its moisturizing qualities, and I have to agree.  Your skin does not feel dry after using Dove Men+ and the scent is agreeable and not too floral, which is my only objection to standard Dove soap.<br /><br />Like all moisturizing soaps, it does tend to get soft, and if rubbed hard with a terrycloth washcloth, can wear away fairly fast.  But if you take it easy and keep it elevated in the soap dish, or use a wire grid type shower caddy, it will last as long as most soaps.<br /><br />So--for its anti-drying properties, effective cleaning, and pleasant scent: 5 stars"
R2ESVN1S7TKDAK,Instyler,I am very happy with the Instyler. It has meet all my expectations!!

RNN4ZFPEGMBGY,ATTENTION: For those who has dental implants.,"ATTENTION!<br />If you have dental implants, be cautious.<br />In my particular case, the &#34;Listerine Total Care Zero&#34; works very well around my teeth (pockets are getting smaller), BUT at the same time the pockets around my dental implants stay of the same size, or even getting bigger.<br />This is the only reason why I have this product one star. Otherwise, I would rate it with 5 stars.<br />IF SOMEONE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM, please let me know."
R2YPM4YU5PYI0V,Im very disappointed,This product is not what is described
R384QYLX1YJCUQ,Nice Seasonal Color,"This polish is a lot thinner than I expected. It dries fairly quickly, but I find myself having to do 2-3 strokes for full coverage. It is, however, a beautiful color. Especially for the upcoming Fall season."
R1E9I716REA22,This is one of the best mascara I have ever used,"This is one of the best mascaras I have ever used. Makes my lashes look really long, doesn't flake off during the day and doesn't irritate my eyes. I normally just put on one coat, but if I want to really go crazy I do two coats. I stopped using my eyelash curler, because it isn't necessary with this mascara - at least for me. I would recommend you try it and see if it works as well for your lashes. The cost is low, so not a huge burden if you don't like it."

R25AT067I5BQ9G,I am under 30 so I don't have much in the way of age spots or wrinkles but I feel like this would be a good preventative moistur,I have several products from this company and this is another win for me. I have always had issues with my neck being dry for some reason and this soaks right in and smooths the skin out. I am under 30 so I don't have much in the way of age spots or wrinkles but I feel like this would be a good preventative moisturizer. I have only been using a few days so no change in my skin yet obliviously but I have high hopes that it will keep my skin hydrated all day long during the colder months.

R1A11178HKDP0B,"beads well, good for 3d art, super cheap for the decent quality/quantity","Nothing was spilled, nothing was broken, the containers were filled up to the top, and the things were packaged neatly. Different sellers package this item differently, I ordered mine from Windmax, if that helps...<br /><br />I wanted to do 3d nail art and I ordered two kits - a professional one, and this cheap chinese kit. Honestly, this kit is pretty damn good for the price. The powder is nice and fine, doesnt leave a gritty texture on the 3d flowers and stuff I tried drawing on my nail. The curing/drying time of the acrylic liquid is medium-speed, and gives u plenty of time to shape all the 3d figures properly. The brush is actually pretty good and allows you to get a nice round acrylic bead. The powder beads perfectly well.<br /><br />Attached are two pics:<br />1) how the package contents looked upon arrival<br />2) some very amateur 3d art I did with these acrylics (I've never done 3d acrylic art before.)"

R1A3071VYGW7UT,Smells and feels delicious!!,I've had extremely dry and itchy scalp since having my daughter a year ago. I've also become extremely sensitive to different scents as I'm getting older i've noticed. I decided to try this because everything else seemed to either make my hair greasy and itchy or extra dry and itchy! So far I am absolutely loving this. I've reduced to washing my hair about 3 times a week and this is becoming part of my routine. It smells amazing and my scalp doesn't feel insanely dry after using. It's only been about 2 weeks since I have received it but so far so good. The scent is so light and refreshing which is a huge plus!! I did need more than a dime size amount because It wasn't working up a lather. But other than that this is definitely a product I plan on continuing to use.<br /><br />I did receive this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

R305HGXWE3WVVI,"Pretty, but heavy.",It came bent in an envelope and it left a weird kink in the middle of the piece. I never go the kink out and had to use my hair to hide it.

It certainly does a great job moisturizing my face. The scent isn't all that great, but it's very easy to apply.<br /><br />As for acne, I'm not sure if it's helping... I think I'm starting to see my acne creeping back up. I may unfortunately resolve back to my other acne cream (which is not as natural)."
R18T000IIYGVVL,Unpleasant Smell and Texture,"I usually buy Neutrogena oil free moisture or similar generic brand, but they're bit pricey, and I hate the way the pumps give out when the bottle's still almost half-full.  No pump on this brand, so that's a plus; figured worth a try.  BUT,label claims, among other things, that it's made by &#34;sensitive skin experts&#34;.  Well, I'm a sensitive skin expert, since I've had it all my life, and this &#34;rich, calming moisturizer&#34; is stinging my face as I write this.  Bottle claims stuff is &#34;perfume free&#34;, &#34;replenishing&#34;, &#34;hypoallergenic&#34;, and blah, blah, blah...  It has a VERY unpleasant smell and sticky texture.

Arrived very well-packaged with extra care that it wouldn't leak. I have to say, however, that because this product is now so HTF and expensive, I purchased a similar product at the store on clearance for $1 and the other product held my waves for longer than the Sunsilk does. I will still continue to use this product until the bottle is empty (mainly for the scent) but there are other products that work just as well for me, that I can find much cheaper at the store. Thank you so much- I will definitely miss the scent of Sunsilk Sea Mist Waves of Envy once I've used up this bottle!"

It smells really, really good and creates a nice lather with just a little soap, and it feels so gentle when applying to my skin.<br /><br />I’ve used it as a face and body soap and it leaves skin feeling really clean, soft, and hydrated; it’s not drying at all. It hasn’t caused any type of irritation or made me break out any more than usually, which I truly appreciate.<br /><br />I store the soap on an open plate by itself and it holds up perfectly. A little goes a very long way, so I can see just one bar lasting a couple months (or more) depending on how often you use it. All of the amazing ingredients along with the benefits of Chaga, make this a must-have soap.<br /><br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine."

R20R1728WYF8V0,Konjac+Charcoal=Great Product!,"Konjac Sponges are my latest obsession.  As a sufferer of eczema I am always on the prowl for products that will keep my skin in great condition.  Zent Natural Essentials has a really good product in their activated charcoal konjac sponge.  Konjac is a 100% natural fiber deriving from the konjac root.  Konjac is great at skin exfoliation and eliminating dead skin cells.  Activated charcoal is great at pulling out impurities/toxins and killing acne-causing bacteria.  Put konjac and charcoal together and you have the Zent Natural Essentials Konjac sponge.<br /><br />I've been using this product for about a week now and I am in love.  This konjac sponge provided the perfect amount of deep cleansing and exfoliation.  My skin feels very soft and smooth and since using this product I have not had to use as much facial cleaner or moisturizer than before.<br /><br />The sponge itself is very easy to use.  When I received the sponge it was in a dried state.  In order to use the sponge I had to soak it in warm water for about a minute or two.  Once the sponge was re-hydrated it expanded.  It probably doubled in size.  At that point I added a little face cleanser and used the sponge to wash my face.  Now the good thing about this sponge is that you can choose to use a cleansing product or not.  You will still get awesome results.  After cleaning and really exfoliating my face, I rinsed the sponge.  A konjac sponge is kind of delicate so you don't want to &#34;wring&#34; it to get the water out.  You gently press the water out to preserve the sponge.  Once all of the water is out of the sponge it needs to be hung up in a well ventilated area to dry completely.  Zent Natural Essentials included a cool suction cup to hang the konjac sponge.  If you use proper care for the sponge it can last 1-2 months depending on usage.  Since konjac is all natural it will eventually need to be replaced but the more you take care of it, the longer it will last.  Once the sponge is dried it will shrink down to the size it was before being re-hydrated.<br /><br />Zent Natural Essentials Konjac Sponge is really great quality.  It has improved the appearance of my face and saved me money on facial cleaner and moisturizer.  I highly recommend giving this product a try.<br /><br />I have received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products. I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.ize it was before being re-hydrated.  Zent Natural Essentials Konjac Sponge is really great quality.

I use it in the shower, its easy to do and will keep your hair soft and shiny. I pair it with the Hard Water shampoo by Malibu, which I use once a week, and so only use one of these packets once a month or so, unless my hair is starting to feel rough. Follow it up with Pureology conditioner and its a great combo for thick hair."

RVINQXO7R988G,Works great if used correctly and gets super fine to coarse facial hairs.,"I have Epiladys original coil epilator that I have used for many years on my body. It is terrific.  I have gotten a few epilators that say they are good for the face but have not liked them.  They missed too many hairs.  I decide to get this one and am so happy I did.. I have fine fuzz on my face that I hate as it picks up and shows makeup. Using this as illitrated, it removed it all.  It also took care of some coarse hairs I have on my lip and chin area. Hold your skin so it is taut and go in circular motions Slowly. Make sure you are holding it horizontal to your skin and you will find it does work, does a great job and doesn't pinch your skin like the non coil ones sometimes do. Also because of the way the coil works and  rests on your skin the coil gets all the hairs unlike the pinchers that are not right next to each other and therefore miss hairs."
R10D4WYZRVAZPB,Great value - works amazing!,"I found this toothbrush to be of great value over the Sonicare expensive models. I love the small and simply docking/charging station, and how easily the brush head fits onto the toothbrush. It provides a vibration alert every 30 seconds to rotate the quadrant of your mouth, ensuring you get even brushing. The vibrating and pulsing action massages the gums, and ensures that the bristles get in between your teeth, working to remove plaque buildup. My mouth always feels incredibly clean and fresh after using this, and I feel healthier too!"

We couldn't find this particular scent in local stores, so Amazon to the rescue!  My brother has been home visiting at my mother's house, where my son stays during the work day hours and when I would come pick him up, he always smelled so fresh.  It turns out my brother was giving him a quick spritz in the morning.  I love the freshness of this scent, it lasts all day and it isn't over powering.  I wouldn't notice it until I would hug my son in the evening."

R1PJBGPKZ6TFX0,Wonderful nourishing cream,"I have been using this for several years now and I LOVE it. I had an infection on my lips and they would peel and this is wonderful to help the lips heal. I use it every day, because I have dehydration problems. I am in my 70s and have to wear oxygen tubes up my nose so that I can breath. Well, the nose does dry out and a little bit of this helps.

I love travel blow dryers because they are easy to lift and they usually come in 1600 w or less. Bigger dryers are heavy and blow my hair everywhere. This has a surprising amount of power and is very compact. I would give it a five except that the switch is not easy to turn on and off with one hand and it's noisier than I anticipated."

First impression was I love the feel of the gloves they are soft and not rough and I like that the fibers don't soak up the self tan product too much making it glide nice and easy over the areas you want it. I also love that the color of the applicator mitt is brown, so it doesn't leave noticably gross stains, it's also very easy to clean. The mini mitts are also nice addition and instead of using the big for your face you can use the mini ones for a better even application! Very cool I'm happy I got this product in exchange for my honest review all opinions are my own and I love this stress free easy mitt!"

RNT9FUN6VX489,Does not smell like roses.,"Rose hip oil comes from Chile. Is it light amber in color, has the consistence of an olive oil, but soaks easily into the skin. It is a great moisturizer. It particularly heals and lightens stretch marks and scars, and tone the skin. This Majestic`s Pure Rose Hip, does not have a fragrance. I was expecting a rose scent and I am disappointed, that it does not smell as such.<br /><br />I received this product at a reduced price for evaluation."

I also haven't had any problems with it breaking me out."

R3VHWUJDEL7CP1,Pyramid sales product with nothing more than aloe and some sea vegtables at a very high price.,This is just heavy marketing pyramid scheme sales product. You can search and there are many reviews professionals on this product and is nothing really but a bunch of aloe and some sea vegetables. the nutrients listed come from the Aloe only so what.  Good luck finding percentages of anything. We had someone we meet bother us enough to get us to buy this monthly and told her to buzz off. There a tons of real green food powders you can buy that are far superior to this mystery drink. Your spending a lot of money per ounce for aloe.

I decided to check out a man's shaver and see how that goes. Very scary to use the trimmer edge around the ladybits, but if you go slowly and angle properly you shan't get nicked. Cuts fairly close as well. Overall, so far so good. Will update after varied uses."

R24STONY4GIECB,Put your makeup on like a pro,"Right out the box the brushes look like they are really worth something and I can't wait to try them out.  They come in a &#34;leather&#34; case which is a little flimsy, but I do like that it completely encases the brushes giving total protection for the brushes when not in use. I love the matte color on the brushes - a good clean look.  1st off, the sponges - they are amazing.  The feel is very comfortable in my hands, and I love the contours on them which help get every angle covered smoothly.  Two sponges are included and they work great for blending.  The angles make cleaning up little mistakes a breeze. The red sponge is soft, the tan a little firmer.  The brushes - there are so many to chose from!  The bristles in all the brushes are awesome!  They hold together and are a perfect length so they don't fan out when used. They are a perfect combination of firmness and softness.  The eye makeup applicator is good.  It's pretty close to what comes in a case of eye makeup, maybe a little nicer.  The long handle is a definite plus.  The foundation brush is nice and firm, yet soft enough to be very comfortable.  It spreads the powder foundation like a dream.  The eyeliner brush is very precise. I have contacts, and the bristles were so nice they didn't bother my eyes at all.  My old brush was constantly poking me with a lose strand.  Cleanup is a breeze.  They look like new after a quick cleaning.  After going through my test and liking this set so much, I let my mom try them out, she's extremely picky about her makeup and was blown away.  She wants some of her own now!  We BOTH recommend these brushes for every level of experience.  I received these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, however, I do believe in being honest with my words.  These brushes are fantastic."

ROQ2Q9W9OEC2P,Causes burning sensation,"I often get a mild burning sensation on my skin after I apply this powder, especially if I've used any topical acne treatment the night before or if my skin is dry or sunburned. I've never had this problem with a powder before. The burn goes away within five minutes and I haven't noticed any lasting signs of irritation. Aside than the irritation, the powder works as expected for reducing shine and making my skin tone appear more even for most of the day (unless I'm sweating). However, I don't think it makes much of a difference in reducing the appearance of my forehead creases."
R3I2WPSWSPRG5W,looks great with summer tan,"Very classy beige color, looks great with summer tan."
R2ELZBM2AI4SEA,"Love this toner, refreshing!!","I really like this most. It's so refreshing and love the ingredients. I haven't really noticed much of a difference in my skin but just love using this!!  This doesn't leave your skins oily or sticky like some I've used in the past. Also, love spraying this on my face, so easier then applying a toner with a cotton ball. Get more product on your face by spraying the  using a cotton ball! Would buy again."
RWY10V2NMOA19,Five Stars,Thank you
R10XYJ44RBS4D9,nice light moisturizer,"I've been using this for about a week now every day and my face does seem well moisturized. I haven't really noticed a difference in appearance, but I'm still young enough that I don't really need anti-aging help yet! It isn't heavy, which I appreciate especially in the hot summer months. It is also clear, so you don't need to worry if you miss a spot and don't rub it in all the way. The bottle is tiny, but you only need to use a little squirt to cover your whole face.<br /><br />It does have a really faint smell, I can't quite place what it is but it is almost like curry. It's a mild smell though, my husband didn't notice when I asked him to smell my face! It also fades pretty quickly.<br /><br />I received a discounted bottle to review but all opinions are my own."
R3HUNSE8PVVEM4,Five Stars,I definitely feel the difference and think I'm start to g to see a little difference
R1A3DOYX402QG5,Four Stars,used it once but were very happy with the results.
R2XBRQEBA9XYCR,Five Stars,Very minty.
R1UMN8297LI659,One Star,really cheap- will not use
RQ7P1AABTP277,Great product!,Fast delivery!  Great product!
RS7FNPC088A1F,"Love it, glad to order it in bulk and add to my candle melter!","I absolutely love Lavender Essential Oil and I love being able to purchase it in bulk.  I like to add it to the wax-melter wax and have it diffuse throughout the home.  It's so much more economical than always buying more scented wax.  I did get this product as part of a promotion, but I was glad I did, so that I know where to order this oil in bulk in the future!"
R3JM6THBKF6SHC,NOT an eye cream!,"This is a nice cream- spreads well, hydrates, feels mice- BUT, the reason its &#34;sensitive&#34; is because it has a lowered level of retinol in it. That's the anti-aging agent. So paying the same amount of money for less of the product you actually want. That also means it will be less effective.<br />Also, this a face cream, *NOT AN EYE CREAM*.<br />Overall good product, but be aware of the decreased retinol."
R1SANLQWTI8R3C,PTR never disappoints!,"I am using this product for years now. Very nice for every age, even for peri-menopause, since it is mild enough to not leave tiny scars but effective enough to take care of business. High recommendable."
R2QT3R0XUQNV1L,Good and effective!,"I received the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing & Whitening System for free from Crest through the BzzAgent program. The free product did not affect my opinions of it.<br /><br />I had used a different Crest whitening system prior to this one and I think this one is much better. The first thing I noticed was that the step one toothpaste had a pretty good flavor, unlike the other system I had tried. Overall, this has done a pretty job of whitening my teeth. I'm a regular coffee drinker and have been using this system for about two weeks and I've noticed that my teeth do look whiter. They also feel incredibly clean after brushing with this system. I did have a slight burning sensation on my gums once or twice while using this, but not so much as to dissaude me from using it.<br /><br />I think this is a great whitening system, especially considering how inexpensive it is!"
R19VNJVDHKBYQK,Five Stars,Yes I thin my hair after I cut w/ my  wahl portable haircut trimmer...
R13WKRQUQHA6FE,Junk,"I don't know whether it's the toothbrush or the heads, but after 3 months the top portion of the head stopped spinning (even after replacing the battery and the head.)  A total waste of money and a real disappointment."
R3N4M198VBJ34S,Wig power!,"I get many complements on this wig. It is adorable. And I love it Thank you,"
R3NWAOU2M4NJX6,Nice product,Product is nice to use thank you
R1RC4MK2KUWDJQ,These are the BOM DIGGITY,One of the best decisions I have made was to buy this elegant Bom Bom gift set! I was looking for something different<br />for my girlfriend to score some brownie points and it worked like a charm! Each Bom Bom smelled AMAZING and there's nothing<br />better to end a nice long day with a relaxing bath. Recommended to anyone looking for a very thoughtful present!

R1NFQPT18FY1KL,Four Stars,Only problems with the pencil is the price. A bit too expensive for only 1 pencil.
R2CVQFSVSVBM32,Silky smooth and great fragrance.,"I like this product, 3 in a pack! It has a very nice fragrance and not so strong like Bath and Body products. It also makes my skin feel silky smooth!"
R1N61S4LEZ8WGV,Would buy again and again!,"As a returned customer I received a discount order on this product for being in the VIP club. Me and my husband both love the product. My hair is amazingly clean after use and has increased volume. My scalp feels clean and less irritated. The conditioner is silky smooth and leaves your hair soft. Both products should be used together for best results. My only complaint initially was that the shampoo did not foam up enough however most natural, healthy products do the same and a little more is just needed.  I use other products by Era Organics and I look forward to what comes next!"
R2X3WCR193CHTM,eh,It didn't brighten my hair like the box described. I need to lights it three more times before I get this color.
RHGEP8MP94O1R,Product works great.,Outstanding topical cream. My wife's feet are now as smooth as a baby. Highly recommended. Apply this either in AM or at bedtime and wear socks so product stays in contact with skin .
R2WLKM52FJ4VGQ,Awesome toothbrush. Have had it about a month and ...,"Awesome toothbrush. Have had it about a month and have yet to recharge it. Very powerful and I swear my husband's teeth were noticeably whiter in a week. Great price too. I hope it holds up. The heads are pretty tight and takes some work to change them, but maybe that's a good thing. You won't be dissapointed."
R8RA0AQSYY655,Five Stars,Great deal
R1021CCFK46NYJ,AMAZING!!!,I have roceasa and have had for 20 plus years plusvery dry sensitive skin. This mle cream is amazing. I ordered it from Canada for many years before select vendors now have it on line in the U.S. I really can't be without it or their foaming cleanser. This has saved my skin.
R3K4PLH5VLJ7J5,Five Stars,"Works great removing dead skin, keeps my heels soft!"
R31DA2OYKTBL34,But Shine Whitening is coming in with the assist and making it easy for us with a tray system that is unparalleled,"Whitening strips often fall off my teeth, it’s nuts. Why can’t they stick on? Whitening gel shouldn’t be adhesive and if it is, I am worried. So I understand. But Shine Whitening is coming in with the assist and making it easy for us with a tray system that is unparalleled."
R1N0F7ADS70L69,This comb set is awesome! I haven't found a use for all of ...,"This comb set is awesome! I haven't found a use for all of them quite just yet, but I use them everyday and they are very high quality. Don't really bend and are nice and stiff. The best combs I've ever used!"
RU83ZZQ50VXPD,SEEMS TO WORK,This appears to be working. My hair appears to be growing in thicker. I use it with other Renpure products.
R3G26NUIHIJUE8,Love Love Love It! Buy this for real!,"I've never had a problem with acne.. Ever.. Until a few weeks ago when my face apparently decided it was done falling under the &#34;dry skin&#34; category and became super oily (for me at least).. I started breaking out on my forehead and along my jawline and I decided to do something about it.. I found this toner on Amazon and absolutely love it.. I'm terrible at remembering to do something daily, so whenever I break out I wash my face and apply this with a cotton ball and I kid you not my blemishes reduce in size and redness immediately... I've been using Neutrogena Acne Stress Control scrub but bought the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash after falling in love with this.. I'll write a review on that after I've used it for a while!"
R16O0D4TSNQB4G,Coconut-licious !,Love this fragrant and enjoy that this does not leave a residue.
R2XYW66A8EY4IQ,Works good but confusing directions,I was a little confused by this product. It says that there are ten wipes in the package and also says that there were ten weeks worth of wipes in the box but there were no directions on the box that said to use one once a week. It did seem to help with the wetness showing on my shirt. I received this product for free for my honest unbiased review.
R2E8F1DSBBHCZE,I really love love this mask,I really love love this mask. It does not make your face feel dry like other cleaning clay. It enhance the glossiness of your face. Love it!!!

R3GKRAMVPC25EC,It goes on fairly easily and is really vibrant,"Wow, intense color! It goes on fairly easily and is really vibrant. The lightest colors have glitter or sparkles of some sort in them and they flake off all over the place. By midday, I've got sparkles under my eyes and on my cheeks! The darker colors smudge and tend to sit in the crease of my upper eyelid. Any reapplication needs to happen after some cleaning up."

R1BIAHIF05SWHO,I love the smell!,Tea tree oil has so many benefits I'm so exited to have this foot and body wash. I use it mainly on my feet and under my armpits. I love the way this body wash smell. I love tea tee oil. It is a natural deoderizer and anti fungal. Comes in a 4 oz bottle that will last you a long time.  Just use a little on your scrub and scrub away clean and smelling fresh. I fell my skin instalty refreshe and my bathroom smells good. I think I am obsessed with the smell. It cleans very good and deoderizers. I hate smelling bad. As a wife I love to smell good for the husband.  I love love that it is cruelt free! Has not been tested on animals and it is vegan! That is just a big plus for me. Give this product a try your skin will love the soothing and freshness.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinon.

RJ1EFJHWU1P9S,This product works amazingly on stretch marks,This product works well on old scars and stretch marks. I saw 50% difference after two weeks.   UPDATE: Today is April 23rd 2016 and I love this product! My stretch marks on my tummy is now 90% gone. I applied this lotion to my skin four times a week. Then I would let my skin rest for a month then reply four times a week every other month. The retinal in this lotion is no joke. It burns but not redo cultus. You will notice your skin start to peel and then your stretch marks will start to shrink. I'm a no b.s. Type of person. This product right here works. Period. Point. Blank.for the best results use this product after you take a shower.

R35RVVRNQTEGVY,Upset the manufacture date on the product  . Can not image they can send me item which manufacture in 2008.,"I felt upset when receive the product. The body Shop sent me  3 bottle which the manufacture date on the bottom is in 05.08 , it is too old and the color of lotion was change compare with the one I bought directly from their shop( the date is in 15)."
RSWXWRR68HXM4,Stinks!,"I really needed a product like this because I spend a lot of time outside and have to contend with both the sun and critters that love the taste of my blood. I'm actually not altogether sure if this product works or not - at least the insect repellent - because I have some bites from before I bought it that still itch. One thing I can say for certain is that it STINKS. I can't help but shake my head at their bold lie on the can that states that it has a pleasant smell. Uh...no, it doesn't. To me, it smells like exterminator's bug spray rather than insect repellent. It smells so strongly that it makes me self-conscious and worried if it's really safe to use on my skin. What's more, when I wash my skin repeatedly, even scrubbing, the smell lingers. I don't know if I can keep using it because of that fact."
R3AZQMR69G9O8H,Two Stars,It shedded the first time I used it.
R14OFSHCRQMTGQ,These seem to be better quality than what I had and I doubt the ...,"Just what I was looking for when my eyebrow shaper that came with a grooming kit broke. These seem to be better quality than what I had and I doubt the razor will slide out any time soon. Plus, a set of three helps prevent me from not having one in case one should break, The price is also pretty great."
R2SQITKFHJOEQW,Awesome,"Awesome, sharp and precise.  You will definitely get your moneys worth with these."
RQKUUUKRQ48M2,Four Stars,such awesome products!!
R1SM145TI6DREU,Your face feels great. I'm 54 and have been trying for years ...,I have tried other witch hazel solutions in the past. I decided to take a chance since it has rose water in it which I really and no alcohol. I have been using this product fo 2 weeks and my face has seen some noticable improvements especially making pores smaller. Your face feels great. I'm 54 and have been trying for years to find a good toner.  I think I found it in this product. I ordered another one so I will never be without. One more thing it has a light scent of roses. I love using it!
R2ZWPFX629MREY,I've been using this product for about 2 months & love it for a quick pic me up,I normally buy Jan Marini products but this has been a find for something instantaneous. It tightens your skin & temporarily removes wrinkles. I've been using this product for about 2 months & love it for a quick pic me up😊
R82BQ00AW54AJ,Really gentle and works as a tinted moisturizer - goes well with my complexion.,"This serum started out great and I really like it, but I did suffer a huge hormonal-type break out (under the skin nodules) after about a week or so of using it. However, after speaking to the owner of My Berry Organics, I’m not sure if the serum caused the breakout or if my hormones were just going crazy like they always do thanks to my PCOS. Another factor could be the grain alcohol from the Chaga extract. My skin could have had a weird reaction from it.<br /><br />Other than that, I didn't have any type of irritation or other issues after using this product. The serum is on the watery side and has a little thickness to it. It also smells like alcohol. This scent is not overpowering though and doesn't linger. I don't notice it once the serum has dried, which is does rather quickly. I also like that the serum goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft - not sticky or greasy; it absorbs really well.<br /><br />The serum has some great ingredients in it too like grapeseed oil and Vitamin E. I also noticed that the serum is tinted. It is dark in color and that color is noticeable when applying to my skin, which can be really helpful during the daytime to cover up imperfections. You’ll also notice the color when wiping with a white cloth or cotton ball (kinda like a BB cream).<br /><br />This serum is very unique and you won't find another like it. It's definitely worth adding to your regimen considering the benefits of Chaga alone. Even though I did break out after using this, I'm waiting until my skin clears up to continue just to make sure it's me and not the serum. I will update this review with my results.<br /><br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine."
R1NJY2LKM3YNS3,Is the hand model on the box clapping or feeling the cotton? We just don't know.,"Okay so I know people have different shaped hands, but I'm really not feeling these. The fingers are way too short and the palm is way too large. Forgetting about the hand shape, the end of the glove is too short; it keeps feeling like it will slip off. Also, it isn't stiff enough near the end to stay on, it keeps rolling back and stretching.<br /><br />However, the cotton is nice and breathable, really feels lovely even though it stains easy. I use these overnight when I have thick cream on my dry dry hands, and even after a wash the gloves are still oily.<br /><br />If you don't mind the discomfort of the shape, these are a great deal. Great price especially if you're using them overnight and forget about it once you fall asleep anyways."
R2QV5EAFTWVSXE,We experience a lot of problems with people making fraudulent products of ours and selling them on sites like Amazon and E-Bay,"The Top Coat doesn't cure in UV or LED lamps as per factory direction (30 Sec with LED and 2 min with UV Lamp) Even it doesn’t cure and stay raw after 4 min with both lamps. Moreover, due to this problem I send e-mail to the Manufacture STAR NAIL and got reply: - &#34;I am sorry that you are experiencing problems with this product. Unfortunately, we do not authorize anyone to sell our products on Amazon. We experience a lot of problems with people making fraudulent products of ours and selling them on sites like Amazon and E-Bay.  I sent this product that you are describing to my trouble shooting department and the results were as normal. Curing for 30 seconds under our LED lamp and wiping with alcohol, outcome is as it should be high gloss shine. If you'd like to provide me a picture I can take a look to verify that I used the &#34;same&#34; product that we sell as far as I would be able to, like I stated above Amazon is not an authorized retailer of ours so I can not 100% guarantee this is our product inside the bottle.&#34; Do not buy STAR NAIL products from this seller."
R2N0FKOGJV6L44,I really love this stuff,"I really love this stuff! It smells amazing which of course is peaceful and relaxing. I've tried several types of sleeping blends,  and this on is my favorite."

R205DJUJ5WRQ4F,Five Stars,Wonderful product which I am very pleased with
RAKXQPZHT4QSE,The fine print in the Oral B package insert says DON'T ...,"Came in the same package as my new Oral B electric toothbrush.  The fine print in the Oral B package insert says DON'T buy generics, but of course they say that because they will lose money if you do.  These brushes have plastic cups in them to help polish your teeth with whitening toothpaste.  NOT for use by kids with braces.  Great product; I saw results from coffee stains on the very first use!  (with a leading brand whitening toothpaste)."
R31HIEJXL4F0EF,Five Stars,just as expected
R18EWT12LAOJAI,Five Stars,Love the colors. Ink is perfect
RKUQ1XX7RG28T,Just Bitten means hot pink,"It is a lot more hot pink than &#34;just bitten&#34; as the name suggests. It does last for a long while though, although it does not last 24 hours I only had to reapply once. Be prepared for your lips to stand out dramatically."

RY2V194N77GFQ,Great price for the quantity,My wife loves it! Great price for the quantity. This is my second bottle.
RIVP90D975CMO,"try it, your like it","I did not buy this product through Amazon, though I shop Amazon all the time and love the site. Amazon does have a fair price on this product as well. I received this free to try in the mail from bzzagent. Overall I am impressed with this product and give it 4 stars. I waited to review it till I could be sure of the results. It is a simple two step process. It does not hurt or cause discomfort really. Once I applied too much product and hurt my gums but that was fully my fault and was fine to continue two days later. It really does help to whiten the teeth, now not everyone has strong white teeth to start with, so not everyone will get movie star WHITE, I was one of those people. However it did improve my teeth and will yours if you keep your expectations realistic."
R12EUIGHIO75Q1,"Smooth, clean skin and less acne.","I purchased this product at a reduced rate so my family could review the product's benefits.  This is another product I have purchased recently that my 15 year old daughter had to &#34;snag&#34; the moment it came into the house.  She is allowed to do this as long as she helps me review the product!  I have also used this and we both like it.  We put the mask on after we remove make-up and wash our faces.  Next I just let it sit until it starts to dry, where as my daughter lets it dry completely.  I think we both get great results as we both have clean, smooth skin and my daughter is reporting that the acne she has on her forehead has improved."
RDOTXW71I4MGO,The back board has a silk/nylon feel that is easy to wipe down and the bags are a nice ...,Solid craftsmanship. Does not feel flimsy or cheap in anyway. The back board has a silk/nylon feel that is easy to wipe down and the bags are a nice hearty plastic that feel like they'll stand up well against wear and tear. The bags are also larger than I expected and will hold more than I anticipated for sure! They'll even accommodate my smaller full sized items. The carry handle is good quality as is the hanging hook.<br /><br />The bags attach to the backing by two thin Velcro strips. I wish they were wider for a more secure hold but the compartments haven't threatened to come loose yet. I'll be interested to see how well they hold up with time.

RIGSO4CDR6NXJ,Are you kidding?!,These are the beat quality nail polishes I've ever used. I can't believe how low they are priced. I've used 5 of the colors so far and I'm quite happy with my purchase! I'm going to see if any other shades are offered. Love these
R9GKLPYKMMWJI,"Smells very nice, light scent","Smells very nice, light scent.  Not as moisturizing as I had hoped.  The regular Black Eczema Soap by Shea Moisture seems to be creamier.  I will say that both products have helped with the eczema on my arm - YAY!!!!!!  I was really having a hard time due to this type of eczema."

R3HW4KZYHWR052,It's now part of my regular routine,"I've reordered this item now a couple times.  It's light yet very hydrating and reasonably priced.  Though I'm allergic to fragrance, this one smells like natural fruit, so doesn't bother me at all.  Since I've been using this and other items, friends have commented that my skin looks 'fresh'.  I'm 53 and spend a lot of time outdoors in sunny Arizona, so I need good skin care."

R1S1B4VZ8YE5LD,Amazing Tattoos,"I got this for my little sister, who is super trendy and into temporary tattoos. She loved them and how they looked so real."
R1G9HQX5JZ81MZ,Way Overpriced,"I am satisfied with the product itself and I see a lot of inprovements, but I believe they are VERY overpriced, and the price is going up every month. I dont know for what reason they cannot keep the same price for one month and they increase 1$ per month. I don't like this kind of policy."
R386KO0FBTYKPG,A wonderful device!,"A wonderful device to remove facial hair. I appreciated the instructions on the cardboard slide attached to the remover. It only took a minute to get the process down with very little prickly pain but adjusted quickly. A very simple device with a big result. Too bad I did not look for something like this in the past, it would of save me time and money. A great product!"
R1HROL2ASPMXLV,Five Stars,Nice
R1BOJYYWKED3UC,Splash of color,"These clip ons are fun and colorful. They took quite awhile to arrive, but they are lots of fun to add a splash of color."
R1HNDB3KRVOIN9,Women too,"What is it with all these wonderful fragranced soaps for men these days? If you’re a women, I guess you have to smell like a flower or a fruit. If you’re a man, you’re allowed to simply smell clean. Sorry, but I’m not buying it. I’m female and I use and like this soap. So far, no one has mistaken me for a man.<br /><br />The smell of this soap reminds me of Irish Spring. Mostly, it just smells clean. The soap itself lathers up nicely and rinses away cleanly (although, like nearly every other bar soap, it does leave a bit of a residue on the bathtub). The bar itself is small enough to fit comfortably in my smallish hand, unlike some “men’s” soaps. It also has a nice curve to it with no rough edges. After showering, my skin feels lady soft with no dryness. Recommended, regardless of gender."

R2I3NBPIBAZH84,Love these...,These are fantastic. The pencils are glide so smoothly on my skin. I truly love these. I'd recommend them for sure!
R2LIZ771HFW6IL,Great product for such a low price ***update***,"This is my second Norelco beard trimmer as the first one just died after a few years of good use. for $20ish bucks I could live with 2-3 years of use. This one has more attachments, as my first just had a simple plastic head that went from 0.5mm to something like 20mm. The addition of a smaller trimmer head which makes it easier to use around the nose, and a nose hair trimmer is nice.    Can't speak much to the battery use but I really don't know why anyone would truly need a wireless beard trimmer. You are almost definitely using this thing in a bathroom with an outlet 99.99% of the time.  ***update*** You cannot use this product plugged in if the battery is dead which is terrible. You have to let it charge. My last beard trimmer always worked at full strength if it was plugged in. This is a huge design flaw!"
R3KFIK97Q9N4AQ,So far everything is working,"Just got the machine, all the instructions are there on the light to use and how to use it. If you are not sure how to use the machine there are many videos on youtube. So far I like it, haven't seen huge difference since only used it twice so far but I do feel like it's doing something. Will post update if find time."
R1MP8VXKWNL21O,You don't get what you paid for.,"So, it works as advertised, for about a month. Then, the film on it starts bubbling off and you lose the &#34;fogproof&#34; in that area. Eventually, it fails on the whole surface."

R2XKGZY61C4M56,Fantasic shears.  Incredible price.,"These scissors are great for anyone who likes to trim their own hair.  They're a fraction of the cost of the high-end professional grooming shears, but they're still very well made and more than sharp enough to cut hair.  My girlfriend uses them to trim her bangs, and I use them to trim my sideburns and above my ears.<br /><br />The product description says that these scissors are made using Japanese steel, but there's also no &#34;made in&#34; sticker or stamp anywhere on the product, so I'm not sure where these are actually assembled.<br /><br />The blades and handles are one long piece of steel, and the blue rings around the finger holes are actually a removable, rubbery ring.  They feel and look kind of cheap compared to the rest of the product, so I'll probably get rid of them.  There's also an adjustable tension knob at the hinge.<br /><br />I'm extremely pleased with these shears and definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to cut or trim their own hair at home.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
RP5E0PHLBZN3S,One Star,It was the actual product. The formula was completely different from the original.

R2VMU9NQURVWVC,Solid razor at a great price,"I was skeptical at first, but was pleasantly surprised with this razor. For the price this is a GOOD razor with a SOLID feel that gives a nice shave. I am new to using a safety razor and wasn't going to spend $35, $50 or more just to find out if I liked this style of razor. I've been using this thing daily for about 2 months and am still very happy. The packs of included blades are nice as well. They are all Chinese blades so you can't read the packaging, but again for the price it's a great start.<br />One of the butterflys can go out of alignment when changing the blade, but taking an extra couple seconds to close it slowly fixes it."
RBXICSWVOO9AC,Five Stars,Live it!
R30G03JW4N93PM,Good buy,This stuff is shiny enough and dries quick.  Thin consistency and the price was very good.  At Sally's this runs about 6.99 even 7+.  I received two for the price of one an obvious good buy.
RRUPENVB0I55M,Five Stars,I love this thing. First body groomer that I enjoy using.
R2IQGSPFOTHORE,Amazing product.,This product is amazing.  It works better than any other sensitive relief toothpaste.  My dentist recommended it.
R1P48MHRNQWQ8A,Solid Brush,"Overall this is a great brush for applying foundation. It does put it on a little heavy, but once it's on it's easy to blend the make-up.<br /><br />Nice quality."
R3F6T41TER5KSB,Not for sensitive acne prone,"If you have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin, do not use this or any oil on your face! I thought this would be the exception since it mimicks sebum, but it gave me pimples like every other oil. My high maintenance skin doesn't tolerate oils, color, perfume, petrolium ect. So its worth it to spend the money on natural products without these"
R1R7CGIGMFIFBM,Waste of money,This brush sheds too much.  Does not even last for 6 months.  Waste of money.
R1H2T7VTL17QP,This is a good Thermal protector spray,"This is a good Thermal protector spray, the smell is very pleasant. it helps keeping my hair healthy. Very good product. I would highly recommend."
R2Z6Y1XBTMK7OZ,"Fantastic product, plumps up skin without making it oily.","Great product. In the morning I use it over my toner (with a light moisturizer if needed, but not during the summer) and at night I use the Etude House Collagen Cream over this essence for extra moisture. I love it because I have oily/combination skin with blackheads and it really plumps up my skin without leaving excess oil behind. One pump is enough for the whole face so the bottle will last at least a few months if you use it twice a day."

R1Z4W45BJRZ77U,"Covers acne, acne marks, and scars easily & stays on!","I always like to use a concealer since I have acne, acne marks, and scars so I chose this concealer stick with this in mind. This NYX Cosmetics Concealer Stick glides on very smooth and is very easy to blend in. I love that it is waterproof since this makes it stay on much better. I have oily skin so runny, smudgy makeup is a problem for me.<br /><br />The Tan color is a bit darker than my skin (I am fair skinned) but I like that since it covers the red spots up and I can cover the concealer up with a light colored foundation. I usually glide it on top of the spot & then pat it in and around the area to blend it out. I could have probably gotten away with the Porcelain color as well. Depending on my mood I wear powdered or liquid foundation. Either of them work great on top of this concealer stick. The nice, sleek design fits great in my makeup bag and purse. The concealer washes off easily with makeup remover but not so easily with pain water. I received this in exchange for an honest opinion."

R3I3WU5BMHF7H,Two Stars,not very powerful
R2AG90TYLWPDKV,The ONLY reason I held back a star is due to effort neededto do this.,"This product did cover the gray far better than ANY grocery store brand (and I have tried many of them) has done.  But the amount of time and effort and clean up needed to use this product (in addition to the unpleasant smell) left me wondering if I would bother with again.  Since some time has passed and the smell, mess, and the amount of effort are behind me now (and because I am actually impressed with its ability to actually do what so many other products claim but fail to do....cover the gray) I am now thinking I will buy this product again.  Other reviewers claim that it is &#34;a little more effort&#34; than other products...but I say it is &#34;a LOT more effort&#34; than the other products but at least it does what it claims to do... which is very refreshing."

R3MRHQGHEW7PPG,Use this for daily shaving (along with a badger brush) ...,"Use this for daily shaving (along with a badger brush), and get at least 3-4 months out of a tub.  Much gentler on the skin than traditional shaving cream, more pleasant smelling, and when you factor in how long it lasts, probably an economical choice as well."

R1QDRQS3FOIGI9,"Smells heavenly, cleans perfectly!","This soap smells SOOOOOO good! It is a rather masculine fragrance, so dudes in your house will be happy to use it since it won't make their hands smell like flowers, fruit or vanilla candy. This is a difficult scent to describe; woodsy, spicy, a bit of leather, herbaceous -- it is rather sexy actually.<br /><br />The foam works great to clean off all kinds of muck and grit. One pump gives you plenty and leaves your hands feeling clean without being stripped of their moisture.  I LOVE IT! I bought the last 6 bottles of this off the shelf since it is a limited time scent and had already been discontinued on their website when I found it."
R3OD3S7RN7RZUA,okay product,"I was very excited to get this product free thru crest and bzzagent. I did not mind the two step process at first. Step 1's tube I loved-the flip cap was great. I hated the step 2 screw cap. The first couple days my gums hurt but that got better quick. My teeth did not get much whiter. I do drink lots of caffeine (pepsi and sweet tea) so that could be the problem. I will continue to use this toothpaste because it was free, but I do not think I would buy it again."
R1OAVGQJP4FTY8,"Great for legs, smooth, and knick free!!!","I received these BIC Soleil Glow Disposable Razors for free thanks to BzzAgents & BIC.<br /><br />After receiving the invite to partake in this campaign I didn't shave until I got these razors in order to get the full effect. While shaving it felt almost as though I wasn't. With normal razors I'm always knicking my skin and other such pains of typical shaving. Using the Soleil Glow it was such a smooth shaving experience, thanks to the blade guard. No knicks no cuts. Just smooth legs. The only negative I have with these razors is that because of the blade guard getting to the sensitive areas along the bikini area because of the size of the blade guard.<br /><br />Pictures included are of my overly white legs BEFORE & AFTER using the BIC Soleil Glow"

RG9IEYQ0EMBZU,Surprising results! Good-bye dark circles and under eye bags!,"I have always had dark circles under my eyes, no matter how rested I am. I typically use a lot of concealer to cover the dark circles and bags under my eyes. When I was offered this product at a free / reduced price I figured, what did I have to lose? It will either work or it will be like every other product I have tried and it will be thrown in a drawer to collect dust. After the first use I noticed the dark circles and bags weren't as prominently defined. They were actually noticeably lighter. Now I don't have to use as much concealer! I look much more rested. I would definitely recommend this product to all my friends and family."
R39PFM62RSCMR6,"works, but not for long.","The product works, but doesn't last longer than 30 minutes it seems. You would have to continually reuse it, which seemed like too much of a pain to me."

I am currently 3 months pregnant, and suffered through some bad pregnancy gingivitis during my last pregnancy.  I feel like this product has staved this off for me this time around.<br />Though I initially balked at the 2-step system (why do I need to put them on separately?). My teeth FEEL clean when finished and are much whiter than with my previous routine, and that's a good enough answer for me.<br />I will purchase this toothpaste going forward, well after my free sample is all used up!"

I don't like the consistency however; it is very watery and thin compared to the previous product I used (Serumtologie Vitamin C Serum 22) Will finish off the bottle and see if anything remarkable happens. Otherwise, probably return to the other product just for the texture alone."

R2B60A11ZV36J2,all good quality and I love the blending sponges,"Many different size brushes, all good quality and I love the blending sponges."
R2S5OKXBKIO7HQ,A Decent Daily SPF Moisturizer,"Let me start off by saying I was hoping that this could be my standalone sunscreen (ie to be used under my day cream), but I find it was moisturizing enough on its own so I'll just review this as a moisturizer w/ sunscreen.<br />This tube is slightly small for a moisturizer , but for the consistency and for being a sunscreen product, it's a nice size that will probably last me at least a few months<br />The consistency is runny, but thick. It feels a little heavy on the skin at first but soaks in completely after about 20 seconds. It has a faux tropical coconut scent to, I somewhat like it, which is good because it tends to linger for a while. It slightly leaves my skin looking a little oily, but a little foundation over it fixes that, and it doesn't leave any white cast<br />Now for why I only gave this 3 stars is because, for the price, you can get Japanese sunscreens for cheaper, about the same size, and better protection, with less residue. I also didn't recognize the sunscreen ingredients used in this. While the ingredients aren't dangerous or harmful, I don't totally trust them. Personally I would have  preferred in they would have used zinc oxide despite the white cast it leaves.<br />Overall, I like the texture. It didn't break me out and I didn't burn when I used this, but I just don't think its worth the money (even though it isn't much) It's a decent daily moisturizer with spf, but I'd prefer something else when it comes to my sunscreen"

RHOGS1MC49YF9,Body,"With long hair it helps to have something help to give it body. This product is supposed to be put on damp hair, using 4 to 5 pumps and avoiding the roots. It also advises that it can be used as a touch up during the day on dry hair. I have found that this does not really add body but it does add some shine and softness. It does not make your hair look oily or stringy looking.<br />Those who have very fine or thin hair would probably be the ones who would benefit the most from this product."

R2OASC7YPX4KAS,Better than I expected! Love it!,"I really love the feel of this sponge. It's very different than a standard sponge or even other beauty sponges. I use it with a facial cleanser and when I rinse it with water and rub the cleanser off with the sponge again, it pretty much removes all the cleanser. I know because when I rinse my face one last time directly with water it feels like I don't have any product on my face and my face feels squeaky clean. I've found after using this for about 2-3 weeks that my face breaks out less and is clearing up. I have moderate adult acne. I love this sponge!! It feels spa-like too, very soothing!"
R1V8D6Q9CQ41VF,Nice clean scent,"Nice clean scent. Good light hold. Right up there with my favorite Mr. Ducktail. Only thing that worries me is availability, but that's a part of its coolness. Made in small batches."

R2BSEZII1I431B,A beach hair look but the tacky feel isn't for me,"This product works for me somewhat. It does not only give me the air blown, wavy beach hair look but also the tacky feel that I get after a day at the beach. I shampooed my hair as usual, then towel dried it and sprayed it with this texturizing sea salt spray. I let it air dry. The results have the beach hair look but I particularly don't like the tacky feel of it. It leaves my hair feeling weighed down and dirty, like spending a day in the salty breeze on the beach. It is just not for me.<br /><br />The spray has a pleasant scent. It fades away after a couple of hours but during that time people would notice it."
R2QU8JS63HD93P,good results,"I got this product because lately I have notice bags under my eyes, the first thing I notice when I put it on was the pleasant scent of cucumber, I like that I can recognize most of the ingredients and they work, I put it on and saw a slight change within minutes, I'm  posting pictures of the before and after, I am very happy I was chosen to review this product for free, and I'm very happy with the results, I also like the pump dispenser as you get just what you need"

R28WI3PQEZ9MCZ,So the scoop on Dead Sea mud; It's known ...,"So the scoop on Dead Sea mud; It's known for its high concentrations of salts and minerals which include magnesium, sodium, potassium and calcium. It has connections with health benefits and is renowned for its healing properties. As far as for your skin it has been used as an over the counter treatment for psoriasis, eczema and acne. Cosmetically it can improve skin elasticity and minimize pores, wrinkles and lines. So now behind the science of this stuff, the mineral content accelerates natural exfoliation (the removing and renewing of dead skin) and restores your skin's pH balance with regular use. When it dries, toxins from diet, pollution, and even makeup are naturally drawn out. Now I knew about these benefits and have been regularly using this mask, and can attest to these benefits. BUT I also found some other things this mask can help with while researching the Dead Sea. Are you ready for some craziness? It has been used as a preventative measure for hair loss, and cellulite. Because it increases blood flow and circulation it keeps hair follicles oxygenated and promotes the growth of proteins, for cellulite it prevents the bumps being accentuated and enlarged by fluids trapped in skin tissues near the surface. This mud comes from the Dead Sea where it is naturally formed. The Dead Sea boarders Jordan to the east and Israel to the west. It has been a source of health secrets for centuries.<br /><br />Basically, slather this all over yourself to look forever young. One day I will fill my tub with it and relax, and when I get out I will look 10 years younger, at least that's what happens in my dreams ;)"

R26V9A2CGOCECM,Don't Do It!,"This is the second foot file that I have tried and it is awful. They proclaim a flexible head but you cannot even put the weight of this unit on your foot before it stops working. I knew I was in trouble when I opened the box and it had dollar store batteries in it. Also the rollers were very ineffective, they hardly removed anything. Mind you I do not have rough calluses either. The quality of this product was like it was a free promotion at a trade show. I bought it because of the positive reviews but now I wonder where those reviews came from because they certainly were not talking about this unit."
R2V2LS49DHX6MA,Good,Good product. Moisturize lips. But it has strange smell which I can not take at all.
R13LIP2VLBO3EJ,Surprisingly good buy!,"I was hesitant buying eyelashes online, especially since prior experience was less than, but I have to say I am glad I gave these a try! I love how the band is basically fishing wire, so it is easy to hide. I do not know how these will hold up long term, but for the price I cannot complain. Product came way way way before expected delivery date which is always nice. Definitely satisfied with my purchase!"

R2MFZ9L29Y35V0,Excellent...,"I am one of those people involved in the kind of alternative lifestyle that can often lead to significant bruising. I also bruise like a peach naturally. I've tried a number of arnica gels and creams, both purchased online and in the drugstore. Honestly, I think I've tried them all. This is by FAR the best in terms of value and in terms of application. The scent is pleasant and innocuous once dried, the packaging is attractive, and the ingredients are the purest I've found. Also, most drugstore brands include a hefty amount of alcohol, which I can only assume is designed to expedite the drying process. Unfortunately, the alcohol is also extremely drying to the skin and can be uncomfortable when used over large areas. This arnica contains no alcohol and has been wonderfully gently on my sensitive skin. I will never use another brand again."
R2PQAW54PRW76K,Love these!,"Great nails. One of my favorite set to buy.  They look great. Glue them on, they stay for two week.  I don't recommend using the press on &#34;pads&#34; with these, they don't stay on for long and they fell like they are going to pop of every time you touch something."

I buy 2 tubes in local Bath and Body Works (not real crazy about walking through that store) for $20 and get a 3rd tube free! Seriously, 3 tubes for $20. As opposed to my favorite Taylor of Old Bond Street where one container is $17. Stuff lathers up great, feels great and smells great. Remember; the greatest trick the devil ever played was making us believe &#34;wet shaving&#34; was money saving!! This stuff is an absolute bargain and works great!!"

Just simply run a little warm water over the end and it will work like new. Love the scent and so does anyone I have been around while wearing it I just wish it were available in stores still. Remember what fragrance you like is very subjective so to say it smells strange is just a matter of personal taste."

R27WB9DMH80HHJ,Good product with some reservations,"The product did seem to improve the whiteness of my teeth. It worked especially well since I do not have &#34;perfect&#34; teeth - my lower incisors particularly overlap. For this reason, using the usual whitening products produces limited results. Being able to particularly address these areas (previously damaged by antibiotic treatment) did produce some results that even the dentist had not been able to achieve. The taste is a mixed bag. I did not find it objectionable, neither did I have any major sensitivity. I would recommend being careful not to brush any gum areas which does produce sensitivity in the areas brushed.<br />[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]"
RL7GBNQ7YU61N,I Adore This Luxury Soap!,"Until recently, I didn't often think about the difference between ordinary soap and higher-end kinds, but after several trips to France where I used and purchased French milled soap with higher end ingredients and scent, I realized that soap can be a true luxury.  Such is the case with this Australian Natural Soap honey and almond soap.  Not only is the scent intoxicating without that cloying artificial blast you can get from some soaps but also the soap has a creamy, smooth feel when used.  I love that the Wavertree & London brand uses plants oil, including shea butter and vegetable glyercin, making it perfect for vegetarians.  (Vegan won't be happy about the added honey in this particular bar, though.)  Because it's French triple milled, it should keep the scent and consistency all the way to the end.  Note:  I received a free sample for review.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"

RT84RHM269UI1,This is the best flat iron I've ever owned,"I was hesitant on getting a small flat iron because I have always used wide plates. This is the best flat iron I've ever owned, it works as fast and my large plated flat irons and makes my hair look so nice and shiny afterwards. The only thing I don't like is that there is no timer and it does not automatically shut off; when you're as irresponsible as me that is something you definitely need."

R2HV6J9D5UIWNO,Great!,"It is a bit too shiny, but my hair mostly covers it anyway so no big deal. What little might show through looks like hair, rather than net or mesh, so it's more realistic and unnoticeable.  It is heavier than the mesh ones, but since my hair is thin and the form can sometimes peek through, this one is better for me.  I recommend it, and I would buy another."

It does not seem to help as much with regular, or larger acne I get on my chin, and does make my face shiny. I use a moisturizer and pressed powder after to help with the shine. I cut the pads in 1/4 and can still use it on my whole face."

R3M7HCR4NVF4FH,I would not recommend using this product unless your skin is between the ...,"This product is definitly not for acne prone skin. I would not recommend using this product unless your skin is between the normal to normal combination dry (and possibly mature) type.<br /><br />I noticed on the first day of use that my cheeks around my nose erruped into little bumps of acne that never quite came to the surface of the skin. Discontinuing the product stopped the unusual breakouts and since discontinuing, the breakouts have healed.<br /><br />I can't say much about any of the other claims; I was never able to use this long enough to attest to them."
RNFFYPJ1VHOV4,Not really for electric razors,"I followed the directions and tried to use my electric razor to no avail.  First it was sloppy as it foamed up and my electric razor slid over everything without doing much cutting.  Then after the sloppiness subsided, it became hard to move the electric razor on my face.  In any case, it may work fine with a regular razor but not with an electric.  Afta Pre-Electric was many times better but has a smell which I don't mind by my wife does.  I am giving my 2 tubes of this stuff away."
R6JH3RTS8TYGS,OMG what a smell to diffuse!,"Bergamot is a citrus fruit whose rind is used for extracting the Bergamot Essential Oil. I highly recommend using bergamot essential oil as a natural, chemical-free mosquito repellant, insect-bite salve, deodorant, inhalant, and relaxing massage oil. Bergamot oil can lessen stress and anxiety levels of patients prior to surgery. It also relieves depression and eliminates chronic fatigue syndrome. So grab your diffuser because the smell is amazing!!! Although essential oils blend well with one another, bergamot oil goes particularly well with other essential oils such as black pepper, clary sage, cypress, frankincense, geranium, jasmine, mandarin, nutmeg, orange, rosemary, sandalwood, vetiver and ylang-ylang. A Few Words of Caution: Bergamot oil must be protected from sunlight, because bergaptene, one of its components, becomes poisonous if exposed to sunlight. That is why the oil should always be stored in dark bottles in dark places. So if you are buying this product keep it in the bottle it comes in because you don't have to worry about it going bad. Exposure to sunlight should even be avoided after it is applied or rubbed onto the skin, at least until it absorbs into your skin.  I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own."

R2MS1HDTJ50B45,All that being said my wife still loves it and would like a second one,My wife loves this!  We gave it a 4 star because when my wife slides the USB out the slide tabs goes partway under the bar that is supposed to stop it. This makes it a little more difficult to slide the USB  back in.  Also the rose part is heavy and the USB is extremely light.  When you have this plugged into a computer the rose pulled downward.  All that being said my wife still loves it and would like a second one.
R1L1GV2XMNWF9C,Four Stars,its all good…but the table insert supports are plastic..I wish they were metal as is seems a little flimsy
R25EOBUMP1094G,Just Great!,"Loving the fact that this shampoo is sulfate-free and is all organic. You can pronounce all the ingredients and they aren't like 30 letter words! This shampoo is enriched with a bunch of oils and extracts that have a ton of benefits for your hair. First, I start off by wetting my hair and then I massage the product throughout my whole scalp. The shampoo has a decent texture. It is somewhat runny, yet not really that liquidy. As I am massaging the shampoo into my scalp, I can feel it cleaning my scalp. When all is rinsed, my hair feels cleansed and very hydrated. Even though this is sulfate-free, it has a pretty decent lather. And the smell, the smell was wonderful and left my hair smelling great for a long time. It smells like oranges with a hint of mint. So crispy and refreshing. There is a pump included with the bottle, so you can control how much you want to put on your hair and scalp. Since I have been using this for a week, I haven't quite noticed thickness in my hair yet but there is quite a bit of volume in my curls. So hopefully when I use this more, I can notice thickness. I love the ingredients! There are no alcohols, sulfates, parabens, and no chemicals. There are a bunch of beneficial oils like coconut oil, jojoba oil, and peppermint essential oil. All the shampoos I have ever used had water as their first ingredient- which means water is most of the product. But with this one, aloe vera is the first one! Aloe vera is very soothing to the scalp and skin in general and has quite a lot of benefits! This product shipped out to me pretty fast and I am amazed by it! I will definitely be purchasing another bottle when this one runs out!"

R28IRI0F4XQEA3,not worth it,"great color, however its not waterproof, also rubs or smears very easily, i was excited when i did get them but immediately became disappointed upon using these.  I bought several different colors and each one was the same result. The colors dont resemble the pictures."

R1EDA443513MI,"Great, cheap masks!","Always packed with moisture and with a great range of masks. Innisfree masks are my favorite sheet masks - they're not thin enough to rip, but aren't thick and uncomfortably heavy. You also cannot beat the value."
R33YW1248ZU8ME,Finally found a headband that works,"i have extremely thick hair and have been searching for a headband that holds it back. This headband is still a bit less heavy and sturdy than I would like but it's the best I've found. Took a few weeks to ship to me from China but for the cheap price of $1.88, that was no problem."

R21VKS0R8879B8,Disappointed,We hadn't used this until recently and it was horrible!  It went on thick - didn't glow at all and wouldn't come off the kids skin for two days and not without scrubbing...
RPNAOCHSJ2AVJ,"Shiny teeth, fresh breath",I really liked the feeling the products left in my mouth. I feel like I have very fresh and clean breath. My teeth appear shinier than they used to although I don't believe they are any whiter. The first paste feels like it dries my mouth out when using it but the end result is well worth the minor discomfort. I'm not big on using two products (don't like to waste any more time :) ) but it is a quick process overall.<br />[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]

RBLWDDLIRFZ40,Good stuff,I used this dye in black on my eyebrows due to the eruption of gray hairs.  I think it works well and not too messy or time consuming.  I use regular peroxide to develop it and apply it with a qtip.  The first day the black is a little shocking but by Day 2 it's perfect.  I may experiment with a brown soon.  My eyelashes are too short to benefit from the application but it's been great on my brows.

R137AVVCEIKKSL,THE BEST GLITTER POLISH.  YOU WILL LOVE THE RESULTS.,"I followed the direction of the person who said use a base coat and several top coats to keep the big flecks in place.  Thanks for the advice.  The other thing I would add is use only one coat of the polish and make sure you get a few of the chunky flecks on each nail.  Two coats is overload and you won't get the nice clean look like in th photo.  The polish really sparkles, glistens and is beautiful.  Less is more."
RE2JPBJ4APFUJ,"Fast Shipping, Reasonable prices and great product!",Ordered the Sponges for my son who is doing the twist curl look. The sponge holes are deep enough for longer hair which I love! This company shipping was really fast and their sponges are more affordable than the actual beauty supply store so I brought two. Sponges were vacuum packed so they won't lose shape. Thank you
R3GCULNANHKMVB,And they kind of slide off your head if you're not super careful,very cute headbands wished the colors were a little more varied they tend to be the same tone without a lot of darker shades.  And they kind of slide off your head if you're not super careful

R2RBPKV7O2UNDP,Disgusting!!!,"Waste of money!  It looks like someone bought some oil in bulk, repackaged it in a smaller container, slapped a sticker on it, and put it in a ziplock bag.  There's no safety seal and it definitely doesn't meet labeling standards.  Who knows what is in this container but I'm definitely not putting in my mouth.  DO NOT BUY!!!"

R3EVPEAHG0ULNN,Highlight contouring,I got this brush recommended from a make up video. It's a decent brush although the I've noticed it looses some bristles and doesn't seem like it picks up my highlighting powder very well. However it is a good brush and I will continue using it!
R32OS14IQT498G,Not the Mascara for Me,"I was disappointed with this mascara. It wasn't that noticeable after applying it. I had to apply a few coats just to see any difference. It also didn't last all day. Who has time to reapply mid day? I use several other products by Physicians Formula which I have been pleased with, but this mascara was just so-so. I liked that it was 100% natural, but that doesn't make up for it being a mediocre product."
R3JWZLJ35CK7UA,I love this mascara,I love this mascara. It gives a perfect natural clump free look while making lashes 3x longer. This is by far my favorite. Although it is ridiculous expensive its by far my favorite.

RBWG6NRU6MNSZ,"Good, clean, simple soap","I like the fact that the Mrs. Meyer's line of product aren't a toxic soup of unpronounceable compounds.  On top of that, the way that they rise cleanly and leave your hands feeling clean (not waxy or stripped of all moisture) is great.  The scents are clean and not overpowering."

I think I should give it some time.<br />Hair type: Oily scalp, dry strands, super scanty hair!<br />Dandruff type: Small flakes only in certain areas of the scalp<br />- I do not use any styling product to be honest and have been struggling with dandruff since I-can't-even-recall when! So I think it's probably got something to do with my eating habits<br />- I use this shampoo every other day since the time I purchased it, not sure if its working though, but will update after a few weeks if anything<br />- Absolutely LOVE the aroma!"

Distribute evenly, smells great!<br />when my hair dries it feels soooo soft and manageable. I recommend this for anyone who needs a little something extra to protect from the elements. (styling, over washing, coloring, harsh weather) it's weightless and doesn't buildup."

R3W38IPZOBAG0B,I have seriously used this clay every day so far and I love it. The other great thing is- for face ...,"For starters- I have sensitive skin, combination skin, and I've recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Just had my first change in dosage of meds so between that and humid weather.......my skin went completely out of control! As in.....I didn't wanna leave the house. Luckily for me, this clay showed up just in time.<br /><br />Not only did it start healing up my acne, it healed up a cold sore. Yep, that happened too. (To be honest, I also take L-lysine) but this was the first time ever that I didn't use any other help except the clay (left on over night) and lysine. Talk about relief.<br /><br />Any areas of my skin that didn't have acne was so smooth too. I have seriously used this clay every day so far and I love it.<br /><br />The other great thing is- for face mask alone, this will last you a very long time. I made the mistake of mixing too much...mix very small portions first.<br /><br />I have yet to use it in a bath or as a hair mask, but that will happen soon. I'm just very happy to see y face clearing up, but also looking and feeling smooth."
R3TFRXWY1UK2EV,Five Stars,Excellent quality
R3N0QDOFMSITUI,Okay palette to start out with,"The eyeshadows are nice. Some are a bit chalky, and others are just too hard to use, and mainly glitter. I've had this palette for a year and I've already put pan on some of the shadows. But the shadows are breakable. While the pans are tiny it does take you a while to get through the pan unless you break it. But other than that it is a great palette for a beginner."
R1BEDC15MD1BOD,It works perfectly and I'm enjoying it day by day.,"It works perfectly and I began to see results after about a week or two. I had a bunch of friends of mine that told me about this product and how it worked for them. So, I decided to give it a try and it worked as it suggested on the advertisement. I've read a lot of good reviews about this product and this is one of the reasons why I gave it a shot. It really improved my hair and it has a very good fresh scent. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone."
R3JSB5IHWGO5SY,Do not use it. There are better cleansers.,"It is good. But it kind of dries out the skin after using it, like taking the hydration off my skin.<br />Also, one day, I did not have shampoo at all, so I used this cleanser instead. I know that's stupid but I had no choice. After using it as shampoo, it totally took all the hydration & oil off my hair. My hair just became straw. Can not describe how extremely terrible it was. I just could not take it & cut my hair by myself.<br />But I'll stay neutral for the produc itself. A rating of 3 star.<br /> Do not buy it. There are cleansers that can softly & effectively clean your skin. Those are obviously better."

R7J2ZUCBBW8ZY,definite wet n wild miss,"Picked this up at local drugstore. Wish I didn't impulse buy this (then again the $1.99 price got me). When I put it on, it didn't burn me personally as bad as I saw other reviews saying. However, it did have a slight weird stingy feeling when applied. Also, as soon as I opened it I could smell instantly that it smelt of dish soap. Watered down dishsoap to be exact. The little bottle stunk my entire room up. I decided to use it as a brush cleaner. Nope my brushes now smell like the product, even after scrubbing some chocolate hand soap on it to get the stench out, which helped a bit.<br /><br />Ladies, do not buy at all. Don't even try it as a brush cleaner. Spend the extra bucks and get the nuetrogena eye remover, I hear a lot of positive feedback about that"

R3D2843JESCLP7,Great product for specific hair and uses.,I've used this stuff for a long time. Strong hold but it is only shampoo soluble. So be ready for either washing your hair before bed or having in there the next morning. Good for a matte finish and defying gravity.
R10780KNG25V9J,Would be 5-star product if it didn't rip when peeling from sheet,Lovely but the polish almost never peels whole from the sheet -- annoying to have it rip all the time. Goes against the idea of ease and simplicity.

RAA4AJXYOQKAU,I love born pretty plates,"I can't say enough how much i love born pretty plates. I love that they have them on amazon now as well as their site. This plate has beautiful designs and is etched well. For the price i don't think you will find any other plates that come with such nice designs and etched as well. These are the perfect choice for plates when you want some fun, pretty, unique designs but don't want to spend the money on the more expensive brands. This plate has some beautiful designs and i loved using it. Just another great plate i own from born pretty! Also the customer service is AMAZING with born pretty. They even emailed me first to check if i liked anything. If there is ever a problem with your order for whatever reason they are very quick to fix it."

R35DPAXWDWZ06O,Great for adult acne!,"I am 21 years old, and have always suffered from oily, acne prone skin. My face had cleared up for the most part this spring, but all of a sudden in July I got the most terrible hormonal acne breakout of my life. I know it was hormonal because it was all on my jawline. It's very upsetting to be entering adulthood with what I would consider a pizza face, since I also had some red marks on my cheeks as well. This acne was different than any acne I had as a teen as no matter how often I used typically reliable face washes and such that had worked over the years, the bumps wouldn't budge. I ended up doing a lot of research and decided the less chemicals the better, but still needed that one great adult acne fighting ingredient. Long story short retinol is where it's at, not only for anti-aging but for adult acne as well. Retinol essentially removes thin layers of your skin (slowly and not too harshly) promoting all of those impurities to be raised to you skin's surface for treatment.<br />That being said all of the ingredients in this product, but I credit mainly the retinol, have led to about a 90% reduction in the severe summer breakout that was terrorizing me! The retinol encouraged me to exfoliate those layers of skin coming off, and the salicylic acid then treats the blemishes brought up to the surface. The vitamin c also has a pleasing smell, and I believe has helped improve the overall texture of my skin."

R2GSSK80UTUK3I,Very nice serum. Goes on well and sinks in rapidly,“This is the perfect serum to use under your moisturizer. I tried almost all the vitamin C serums including the pricey ones. This is better than all of them in my opinion. I ordered it for my daughter who is a surgical nurse and her face gets broken out from the surgical mask - and it took care of her breakouts. It's a great serum and I will continue to use it.”
R5KUGB9NV14AM,"Beautiful color with no streaking, easy to use!","[[VIDEOID:cfa13bc0593a75265a131c135bc35120]]This is the second time I have used this organic sunless tanner by Thermalabs.  I have really been impressed with this self tanner. As far as self tanners go, this is one of the easiest, foolproof products out there. I have tried many others but this is the one that give me the best color.<br />Speaking of color.....I am very pale. I mean VERY. Any kind of mess ups are really noticeable on my skin, so I have to have a quality product that does not streak and leaves behind a natural color.<br />This lotion is easy to apply. It's not too thick, and is easy to rub into your skin. I am pretty sure the formula has changed a bit, as I thought before the self tanner by Thermalabs was thicker. {I've used this before--but a smaller bottle.} THAT, I am happy about! This lotion is just the right consistency, so it absorbs nicely and dries quickly. I am definitely no pro at applying self tanner, but I have found this to be super easy. I always get an even color every time!<br /><br />I made a short video to show you just how beautiful the bottle is. It definitely stands out! ;)<br /><br />Tips: I will say that you should definitely exfoliate before using. It's best to remove the dead skin before applying this {or any} self tanner. Believe me, it is a must. I know this--haha! I have dry skin, and I absolutely have to exfoliate. It makes such a difference!<br /><br />One last thing! The scent. It does not smell like a \\""self tanner\\"", if you know what I mean. It has it's own unique scent that in no way smells weird! Hope this helps! :)"

It is a nice touch around Halloween, or really any time you want to have a fun, unique look."

I figured a mini flat iron would be good for my Euro trip so I could save space in my carry-on. The flat iron barely got hot enough to straighten even my mid-cheek-length face-framing layered bangs. I didn't even waste my time trying to straighten my whole head of hair (which isn't much, although my hair is long). I would only recommend this for people with pixie cuts who need a flat iron that gets close to the scalp."
R2D1TJGFEML12U,Protection without the residue,"I'll admit I was skeptical of this deodorant at first, because I usually wear the solid version, not gel. It takes some getting used to, putting a wet deodorant on, but it dries quickly and the best part? NO white residue left on my clothing! I'd purchase it again, but I'd choose an unscented version because that's my particular preference, not to smell any scents."

I got the closed comb since she won't be trimming and detailing a beard like me, and am very pleased with the results. There is a slight learning curve from a more modern razor of course, but once that's past it's a much better shave. It's just different enough from mine that they don't get swapped, which is also nice. Get yourself some feather blades, shave oil and proraso shaving cream and you're good to go."

RUVJVDYVDJZZG,Five Stars,Great!!
ROW11NSWIDDSQ,This is my favorite go-to for mornings I can't get out of bed,"This is my favorite go-to for mornings I can't get out of bed, or prefer to sleep in some. Unfortunately, the sponge material has started coming apart and has made it more difficult to twist my hair through it. The large is by far my favorite, I have shoulder length hair and haven't had any issue with it not keeping it all in there. I haven't used the smallest one, yet, and don't really intend to.. honestly.. although I wish there were a way to buy just the large one instead of all 3, without paying twice as much. I guess if I buy enough packs, I will have enough small ones to do all over my head before bed and wake up with curls.<br /><br />This will hold your hair at the gym, but I wouldn't want it to harbor the sweat and bacteria..and it's not really an ideal gym look. lol."
R2WIB8BHF77XIG,I liked these pills,"I liked these pills, as they were helping, and they have everything I need…BUT my stomach felt bad every single time I took them. I tried a couple other kinds and ended up with Vita Naturals. [[ASIN:B01449RS2K Prenatal Complete Once Daily Multivitamin for Pre and Post Pregnancy.]]No stomach probblems at all, and I only have to take one small tablet a day."

R1JZBERBFV5P6F,3 ounces bottles to access a plane in the United States and I LIVE HERE,"3 ounce bottles - YEA!  So, I can put some shampoo and lotion in two.  I can then place some UV Sun-Block in another and finish the set off with some aftershave just to travel in the United States on a plane.  What a world as the government tells me I can't travel with more than 3 ounces of product in any given container on a plane.  The joy I pay for freedom - BUT THEY work and I &#34;gotta' have it!  Silliness in a silly world but needed, so I bought them.  Maybe I won't get RED lagged and searched to board a plane for vacation.  Born and raised in the United States, but I remember the days when you could have enough shampoo for a long vacation on the other side of the country."
R32JPH26YXH899,Great product,"This is a great product.  First of all, if you travel anywhere you sure don't want to carry a bottle of polish remover with you.  What I love about this is it does not have that awful stinky smell of liquid remover.  I was amazed at how the pads smell exactly like the fruit.  They remove polish effectively and yet are very gentle on your skin.  I always pack one in my suitcase when I travel.  Highly recommend this to anyone using nail polish."
R3U9B0RHJUG17Y,On The Fence,"Verdict's still out for me on this product. I've been using it now for several weeks. My left eyelashes appear somewhat thicker, but the length is unchanged, and this is where I hoped to see improvement. I will, however, continue to use it and hope I'm just a late responder to Lash IQ. I've used Latisse, which worked great, but turned my eyelids a horrible color which took a long time to resolve. I like that Lash IQ does not have that effect."
RJPK3YDZMO6W2,Good enough.,"The bubbler is a cool idea but very weak. Have to set it up and get in it before it gets cold which is minutes. Easier to just take a bath in my opinion. The stone is smooth, and permanently affixed. The roller are sharper. People must have some pretty thick callus' to find the rollers useful. It's in the closet waiting for the goodwill."

R35CB873AGJBPF,Best Brush!,"This is the perfect brush! I have long, straight hair & this brush is amazing. The combination of vinyl & boar bristles detangles my hair easily while also smoothing it out. My husband has short, naturally wavy hair & he loves it too."
RDFS7JFZFNHLM,Five Stars,good product original
R2N4E6UNB79A5R,Goes on Fairly Easily,"I have fair skin, but it's not as light as it used to be, so I hoped that tan would be the right color since the manufacturer recommended it.  Nope -- tan is too brown on me.  Still, as a concealer, it works fairly well.  It's not the creamiest concealer, but it also does not tug at the delicate under-eye skin the way some products do.  I'd put the ease of application mid-way between the liquids and the harder sticks.<br /><br />I struggled with whether to give this three stars or four.  I decided to go with 4 stars since it's not the product's fault that it's too dark for me.  It mostly stays in place, and it's creamier than some other concealers that I've tried.  Note:  I received a free sample for test and review."

R2PWBOXG6Q53V5,Love this conditioner,"I have always been cursed with fine, flyaway hair. I've tried many shampoos and conditioners that claim to make it thicker, but none have done so. I've always heard the best things about John Frieda products so I thought I'd try this one. I don't know if it actually is any thicker, I don't know if anything can do that, but it certainly feels like it, and that's what counts! My husband can actually dig his hands into my hair instead of just raking through it. It doesn't take a whole lot of conditioner, and it doesn't weigh my hair down and make it look greasy either. It just looks fuller and healthier. I'll be trying them again!"

R2LEVRQTGQS5EJ,"Great metallic shine, lasts for days, very fun!","Great metallic shine but a little tough to get off - which is good if you want them to last! They will last for a few days if you don't scrub them off and when you do, just be patient - use some lotion or a nice scrubby body wash, rub in a circular motion for about 2 mins and it will start to come off. They are a great faux look for an event or just because! Very fun!"

It works well with your body chemistry...not over powering but not very subtle either, it's a nose grabber....and it lasts all day too. If you want a great smelling cologne then millionaire by lomani is the scent for you. its sophisticated yet playful. Will be ordering from this seller again...package came quickly with no dents, scratches, or damage."
R1EBOXYC1NF1ZN,"Hair, face, and body!","So many uses!!! I purchased this to be a carrier oil but have used it for so much more on a daily basis. Most notably, I use it on my hair to help control the frizz from taking over. I have naturally curly hair and would not trade my curls for anything, but I am also very active, even in the heat and humidity. The picture attached is of the front of my hair on day two after the oil had been applied, a 3 mile walk with the dogs, and an hour and a half of working in the yard (which is why I am covered in leaves as well). The oil has been a great moisturizer for my skin as well, from head to toe!"
RSELEMLUYV403,Great Headband for people with Sensitive heads!,I love these hair bands and have been looking for them everywhere. They are great for anyone who has a sensitive head. The only thing bad I would have to say is they break easy. But for me I just ordered plenty so I have backups. Such a great product!
R3C9AF5K158NYC,like ylang ylang & jasmine,"This oil has a pleasant scent, like ylang ylang & jasmine. However, I will not be using it because the other oils sent to me to test by this company made me feel sick to my stomach & caused my arm to go numb. I have not had this experience with any other oil & I have used many. Do not buy anything from this brand. Make sure the oils you use have been tested for purity & be sure that contact information is available in case something goes wrong. This was received complimentary in exchange for an honest review."
R3E2KW4TIPNGG9,Great blended with the copper shampoo,"When I read about this turning everyone's hair pink, I decided to mix it with the copper colored shampoo since my hair was pretty sun-bleached, and I LOVE the result. I always use Davine's alchemic conditioner in copper after using this shampoo because the shampoo is a little drying, and the Davines conditioner is very nourishing and also adds some color. I'm not sure what the result would be without using both products. The copper shampoo alone was good, but it was definitely brighter and redder mixing the two together. I've had dyed red hair most of my life ($130 salon color treatments), but only since I started using these products did people start commenting on how bright and red my hair looks! It doesn't do much to make my dark roots any redder (some redder highlights with more frequent uses), but it makes them brighter, so they blend better with my dyed hair color. I definitely recommend this shampoo but with a very good conditioner."
RPS97TN1WLXB7,Dry patches cleared!!,"I ordered this to use for my young son who has some pretty bad eczema on his legs.  I've had him off a few things in his diet for some time and had seen some big improvements but there was always a slight pink to the skin and very rough dry skin.  I used this the first day it arrived in his bath and like magic his legs looked better the next day!  I am thrilled to say the least.  His legs have an even color and starting to feel smoother!  Everyone has a different recommendation for their eczema situation, this is now mine.  I know it may not work for everyone, but it was most definitely worth a try for me.<br /><br />UPDATE: Second purchase ... still loving this salt.  I do believe this is helping to keep my son's skin pretty clear, I haven't had to use any more medicated lotions or anything."
R2ZFA4W3IN052J,affordable,I bough several of these packs con is they take a while as they do come from China pro they come with a lot of pairs and many styles and lengths to chose from and they are beyond affordable but the thing I didn't like is that they are synthetic so they do look shiny but not to much like other lashes I've seen but it clearly says in the description so for what it is it's a great buy with very great price I would recommend for those on a budget or maybe if u are just starting with makeup or learning to apply lashes these are great for that

R242LE1XA29QZV,Who Doesn't Love Clairol?,"I'd never thought to cover my gray hair before, but I tried it anyway and I'm amazed at the results. Of course, this doesn't cover what grows back. LOL But, it did a great job on what was there before. I'd recommend Clairol (as if I'd have to, they're so popular) to anyone looking to cover gray no matter your culture as I'm Black and it worked great for me. It's been about 6 weeks and I haven't had any damage to my hair or negative skin reactions. I even added a fuchsia rinse (Jazzing) shortly after with no problems. I'm not recommending that, just saying that's what I did. :-)"

RR1P63OWVO0UW,Excellent For Travel,"I really love these, very comfortable and easy for me to use, which is a primary consideration for me.<br /><br />I have carpal tunnel syndrome and trigger finger and the design of these allow me to get a good grip on the tool but not pinch my eyelid while using it. Curling was very good to excellent and for me the curl was most pronounced on the outer third of the eyelash line. Without loops on the grip, I found these fit really well into my consmetic bag and likely will be my go to when I have to pack lightly.<br /><br />I was provided with a free sample to review for my opinion. This one is a thumbs up."
R19OR8AEGQBATO,Non GMO Argan Oil Goodness,"A friend recommended argon oil for me to use in my hair to keep it from locking up and remove frizzy ends. I searched out amazon and found Foxbrim to be the least expensive product while still being organic, cold pressed, and 100% pure. Shared link with friend and they were jealous on how cheap, half the cost they paid, for similar product. Product comes with an eye dropper, but I found putting a spray bottle top from one of my travel bottles fit great and delivered the product better for my hair. Use sparingly it goes a long ways. I have also used on my face and feels great.  Update - This Oil is just great. Have purchased multiple bottles for friends and family."

REUKY9DLNJXYF,great product,"I really love this product. It came in a box and inside was the Shea butter in two plastic bags sealed tight. It has a mild nutty smell I but I like it. After I refined it by using the double boiler method and added my oils in , then I put it in the freezer for 10 mins , after that I started whipping it together it only took 5 mins until it was perfectly smooth . I saw other comments on how it was grainy I didn't experience that straight out of the bag it was smooth and melted on my fingers. Even after I processed it into a whipped Shea butter it was very smooth . I had little to no debris in my Shea butter . The only downfall to this was my order was 3 days late!!! But other than that I enjoy this product it at a reasonable price and a great product ! I think I'll be ordering from here again as long as the shipping will be better the next time ."

Dries pretty quick, even if I do my nails before bedtime and keeps them shinny chip free for over a week.<br /><br />Routine:<br />Clean nails, rub with alcohol+cotton swab, Seche Vite base coat, 2-3 layers of polish (I let each layer dry for at least 5 minutes), Seche Vite top coat.<br /><br />Photo 1 = Day 1 of application<br />Photo 2 = Day 10 (no retouching or second application of top coat)<br /><br />Sometimes, if I want my polish to last a little longer, I'll add another coat of the top coat mid-week (3-4 days after the original application)."

R1CD9M30U38OM1,Super Duper Glitter!,"This is UBER glitter polish! I looove it. I love glitter, I love color club! I have a few of their polishes already and they're always high quality.<br />I honestly was not expecting this caliber of glitter, there is so much. I've never seen a glitter polish this dense before.<br />I did have to put some thinner in the bottle and stir it up because it was absolutely way too thick. It was nearly impossible to work with. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be that way but putting thinner in it made it workable and didn't damage the coverage. It's the only glitter polish that only needs one coat.<br />This polish is great for accent nails. I think it would be hard to use it with tape techniques, I don't think the lines would come out clean. I used this as a base coat and used a see through purple to make chevrons so the glitter was still visable. Turned out wonderfully. Was super fun to do. I love working with fun and unique colors. And there is definitely not another glitter polish like this one.<br />With a couple of clear top coats you can make the texture even, or using a gel top coat works as well.<br />Can't wait to use this again!"

RPECBSKZ4ZKNR,Accessible and affordable deodorant which keeps you fresh for whole day!,"I used to apply all kinds of deodorants but almost all of them were either ruin my dress with white marks or ruins my perfume with their fragrance. I used to be nervous in parties because I felt bad when I sweat a lots. Besides, it is sad to buy a dress and lose it after just one or a couple times because of deodorant's white marks and bad smell because of sweat. It would better to find a perfect clear gel deodorant to save cloths and also smell perfect. Recently, I received a completely different deodorant which keeps me fresh for whole day and it doesn't remain any white mark on the cloths because it is clear gel and most of all, it is odorless. I found Secret Outlast® Clear Gel which is a unique deodorant in many stores and online easily. So, it is easy accessible and affordable too.  #GotItFree<br />*************  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. *************"
R2MNER27QZ6JPD,The Best Facial Cleanser,"I've been using LaPrairie Foam cleanser for years. I love it and have not found anything else that will take all makeup off, including eye makeup, with one wash, and have your skin be soft and perfectly clean afterwards. For comparison, I've used Lancôme, Estée Lauder, Clinique, Aveda, and Sisley, not to mention several drug store brands. The only thing comparable to this when it comes to removing makeup quickly without using a cleansing cream or cleansing oil is MAC towelettes. Purity is also nice, but this is better in my judgement because again, you need so little and it does it in one wash. LaPrairie is expensive, but you only need to use a pea size amount for your whole face and you won't break out from it either. It also works well with a cleansing device (Clarsonic). I think it's worth the money."

R3TCQPSB3UFVPI,"This thing holds a darn good charge, 2 weeks with light usage and it's ...","Battery: This thing holds a darn good charge, 2 weeks with light usage and it's still kicking!<br /><br />Attachments: The main attachment is not as sharp as I hoped it would be and I have to remove the blue piece to actually use it to line up. My $15 Remington main attachment cuts sharper. However, the other attachments work well, easily change out and are easy to clean. The vacuum suction works pretty well (not so much sink mess) and you can just dump the hair out when it gets full.<br /><br />Aside from that it is a rather tad bit bulky but I am impressed with it."

R3D1A6UNICDF5C,I love this soap,I love this soap!  There is a visible difference in my skin and I couldn't be more excited about a product!  My skin is brighter and softer.

The result was gummy and sticky. Too much citrus smell.<br />Not liking it ordered another brand."

R2ANCY9YX18WZ3,Leaves hair soft and manageable,"I like the Dove Advanced Hair Series Ultra Nourishing Shampoo. It's easy to work up a rich lather, cleans well and rinses off easily. I use it together with the matching [[ASIN:B00R0UK878 Dove Advanced Hair Series Ultra Nourishing Conditioner]]. Upon drying, my hair feels soft and smooth, apparently with less frizz. The shampoo has a rather strong scent. It's not unpleasant but not great neither. I wish the scent was a tad milder since I didn't really enjoy it in the shower. At least it went away quickly after rinsing off."
RKSCI2V4J98JR,I love this product,"I love this product. A little goes a long ways and it glides smoothly onto your skin. It works really well under make up and it makes it last hours longer than without it. After I apply my moisturizer, I wait til my face dries, then I apply this and do my eyes while it dries and then apply my concealer/foundation. It does smell like plastic/silicon for a second when applying but it disappears after 10 seconds. I love this and use it as a primer over my others."
R1G3FYL7R0BZUK,Everything I expected of a high end razor!,"super impressed with this razor. For the past month I have been using a $19.00 butterfly too double edge razor, which was ok, but I could feel the blade against my face along with the occasional cuts.<br /><br />You can barely feel, if at all, the blade on this razor. No cuts, super smooth shave, even when against the grain.<br /><br />If you appreciate the craftsmanship and performance of high end items, get this razor. Well worth the price when you take into account its performance."

Unfortunately, the damage was already done so I wasn't able to test it on a brand new burn, I was half a week into my sunburn when I discovered this. I did find that I had to do multiple applications during the day as unlike a lotion the oils don't necessarily stay on your skin for several hours. I did like that it was a spray bottle though as it makes application quick and easy. Definitely a good maintenance moisturizer in the summer, but not a heavy duty moisturizer."

I did not purchase this line's brush, but another one offered here on Amazon.  I like the control I can have with this pomade.  It's different from using a pencil, and goes on in a way that strokes are not visible. I have very light eyebrows, so color is definitely needed.  It will probably take me years to use all of this product since I have to use very little at a time. This color was exactly what I was looking for."

After a few days, change of review..","When I first received the product, I was excited because of the price & how much you get with it compared to the name brands. After using it for a few days, this is what I came up with. First, It's very messy as the fibers go flying all over your bathroom. My light fixtures are now full of this stuff. It happens even when applying gently. Second, they don't seem to bond in place, as you have to keep applying. That's why hair spray is recommended. I hate having to put hair spray on my head with that smell mostly. The other name brands it's not needed. Don't get me wrong. pretty good for the price, but I will be using this in emergency situations when I run out of the better stuff."

R2JCJHKK2LOWBH,Badgers?!? Yes We Need Some Stinking Badgers,"This is a great Mug & Brush set for those of you jumping on the wayback machine for great shaving experience. You could probably piecemeal each item but you'll be spending more. The Badger Hair Brush does a great job of getting a good lather while raising all those small hairs on your face and neck. While it has lost some hairs during my initial uses it has held up very well to this point. The stand is clear Lucite, looks good and holds the brush easily for drying plus there's a place that will fit most safety razors.<br /><br />The Mug is a nice heavyweight ceramic one and comes with a bar of pleasant smelling shaving soap. Whether you dry shave or wet shave you'll have plenty of room to raise your preferred lather. Overall this is a good value and paired up with a simple Van Der Hagen safety razor I've been getting great shaves very inexpensively compared to the disposable cartridge razors and canned creams/gels."

This product is incredibly light, smells lovely, and it light and smooth on the skin.  I also believe it will last a long time because one small drop covers a lot of skin.

RMD3LH5XMFLHE,These are great. They fit like,"These are great. They fit like...a glove. A bit tight and take a bit of wiggling into, but the fact they're tight allows you to do other things while wearing them (turning pages in a book, brushing teeth, etc)."
R1RXYVV45CAXS2,Three Stars,It's as good as the ones for less than $1.
R1FMPAUQQOVYS2,"Absorbs well, 20SPF, scented.","I am not sure about the tint, still pretty close to white although a shade darker than Olay regenerist luminous. I picked this LOreal skin illuminati because I was using the Olay at SPF 15 and the LOreal is 20 SPF. They have similar ingredient lists, in varying amounts. The LOreal seems to absorb better and less greasy. Has a perfume scent to it, I would like it better unscented for my sensitive face skin but it hasn't caused any irritation, I like it."
R3MJ8THYNJ7H3I,Loving the results,I was given a chance to try this product out free of charge with Bzzagent. I was really excited when it came in the mail and I read what all it was supposed to do. I loved how clean the first paste made my teeth clean when I first used it and without rinsing I used the 2nd bottle which was a gel. I used this paste for a week and that is when I really started noticing the difference in my teeth color. They really were getting whiter and that made me more and more excited to keep using this product. I would highly recommend this product for someone that wants a whiter brighter and even cleaner smile without having to spend a ton of money on products or at the dentist.
R2KO3N4LSCLOFP,Love St. Ives,"This is a really cool product. I've used St. Ives scrubs in the past and have always loved them. Never had a problem. The last one I purchased didn't seem to have as much of the grainy, scrub stuff in it. (I guess I should know the name of it, but I'm too lazy to leave my desk to find out.)<br /><br />Still, I'd recommend this product and brand to anyone and I'll definitely buy again and again."

RSPU0J9MV4GXA,"Nourishing for the scalp, refreshing and leaves my hair soft","I have been using the Luseta Beauty Tea Tree and Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner over the past week and my hair is soft and supple.  I was asked to test the products in exchange for a fair review.<br /><br />The products arrived in two pump bottles and I was happy that the pumps worked smoothly to dispense small amounts of product with each pump.  The shampoo has a great smell (mainly tea tree) and a wonderful, luxurious feel when lathered.  The lather was perfect and the feel on my scalp was extremely refreshing without being overpowering.  The main difference comes from the addition of Argan oil which aids this formula in providing moisture and smoothness (I am using another Tea tree product which is very very drying).  I love the way my hair feels when using both products together or just one at a time.<br /><br />This is a great scalp calming formula that feels refreshing without overdoing it.  Definitely love it!"

This was a pretty big bottle,and really pretty silver label and has a pump to dispense. I right away liked the smell of it. I used it with wet hair our of the shower, and it went on easily. I let my hair dry naturally like I usually do and noticed a huge difference in my curls. They didn't dry out, but weren't heavy either. Still bouncy. Not sure how to explain it. I can immediately tell that this is going to be my curl's best friend from now on! I'm hoping this company comes out with more products."

R2SE95NE4WTHLP,Helps with allergies and headaches immensely!,"I really cannot say enough good things about this eye pillow. It feels amazing as both a hot eye pillow and cold eye pillow. My husband suffers from bad allergies and this year has been one of the worst. I have tried many remedies for him and it really takes an army to make a dent in his misery! When I heat this up and put it on his face while he is laying on the couch he moans like he is instantly getting relief. It is quite comical but also makes me feel good that I found something that can help him. The lavender scent is a wonderful touch and really helps to lessen his allergy headaches when he has them. I have also heated this up and put it on my neck when I have had a headache. It really is a great cure for many things and will make you feel so relaxed on those days you just feel like your head might explode. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. However, that in no way swayed my opinion of this great product."

R1X10ZK33E8CZP,My hair feels and looks great!,"I received this bottle well packaged and fast. It comes in a nice sized 8 fluid ounce bottle with a squeeze flip top.  The conditioner is white, rich, and creamy.  It feels like a really good moisturizing cream you put on your hands, instead of conditioner for your hair.  That's how rich it is.  It has a light scent that is pleasant.<br />I have really long hair and it is dry and frizzy at times.  There are split ends in places.  I started using the conditioner and followed the directions by using a quarter sized amount and left it on for three minutes. While using the conditioner I could feel how silky my hair was feeling and the tangles I had after shampooing were releasing immediately.  I found the conditioner super easy to rinse out of my long hair and was surprised since it is so thick and creamy.  My hair was very conditioned, felt silky, and there was no frizz at all.  I was very pleased with the results.  I have tried multiple conditioners and there has not been one that has so quickly changed the texture of my hair as this product.  I am happy with this product and will continue to use it as it has that deep conditioning that my hair needs and the conditioning lasts through to the next time you shampoo and condition.<br />**I received this product free for an honest, unbiased review.  My opinions 100% my own.**"

I love that this #ColgateEnamelHealth mouthwash is gentle, it makes me actually want to use it. My teeth are less sensitive to cold and sweets than they were a week ago (particularly my molar that my dentist told me had starting signs of a cavity) only time will tell how much of a difference this mouthwash makes- but in just a week I am seeing improvements which has me feeling positive!"

RBKY1G10OQ75J,A good whitening option,"I thought that my Crest 3D White toothpaste was a good product. I've used whitening strips before and not only are they a slimy hassle, but they are also an extra step in your day and I find I get very sensitive teeth after only a few days of use. The toothpaste is convenient because I already brush my teeth several times a day. I did find my gums were slightly sensitive to cold water after using both steps, but it was not painful, just odd. I noticed my teeth were a little whiter, but I started out with fairly white teeth to begin with. What I really liked about the toothpaste was how clean my mouth felt, even after waking up the next morning. I will also admit that I did not use the toothpaste all the time, as sometimes my lazy butt even thought two steps was too much work. However, I would say it was still easier to brush twice than to use the strips!<br />[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]"

R1O4JOW0CLGT5N,Five Stars,it really works!
RHTZ0RE1YQN6M,Best Edge Control,This edge control is the best I ever used. It is meant for your edges... not to slick in a pony tail! If you have thick course hair put a scarf on your edges so it can hold!! You can't expect for it to hold if you don't make an effort! This is the BEST and most of you just need to find different ways to lay your edges instead of just putting water and slicking it with a brush. Slicking down edges is a process :)
R15P87JWLEQS96,Great product for a wide variety of uses,"We've used Dr. Bronner's products before and always liked them. This one is no different. The ingredients are pure and safe to use. No GMO's to worry about in here! No petroleum products either. My son is very sensitive to ingredients such as coloring and sodium sulfates so it's not always easy finding soaps or shampoos. This can be used as body soap, shampoo, floor cleaner, laundry detergent, dish detergent, pet shampoo (Careful with Tea Tree and cats though), rug cleaner and more. It's concentrated and a little bit goes a very long way. We use this in our hair but if you have easily tangled hair you'll want a natural conditioner as well. There's no sudsing agents although it suds up really great."
R1ZC3EISDO0DYH,I'll  keep buying it.,This is easy to use but I was hoping it would stay for more than 1 day.  Does not smudge.

R1WG20GN81AG6I,Very disappointing with the size for that amount of money. No blush.,"I'm really disappointed about the size of this kit. I bought a kit with larger containers about 5 yrs ago at Ulta, and it was $49.99. It included blush. This one did not That was a starter kit.The veil stuff made my face look ghostly. Also I was disappointed I couldn't find any blush. If there was some it was not listed as blush. The picure looks bigger that the actual size of the products. To me I couldn't believe how small the jars were. It looked like the size a little girl would wear. For that price I would have that the jars would have been bigger."

R8FDPRLGZ5RIX,Amazing,"These are some of the best makeup brushes I've ever used! They're soft, they make applying makeup so easy, and the price is amazing. They do shed a little, but for the price I can deal. I buy these ones and the face set and I am never disappointed. If your considering buying these, do it. You'll be happy you did"

RJ1EHN2TLAW90,Don't Care For Scent,"My husband uses this shaving gel and he likes it, as for me, I rated it only 2 stars because I find this particular scent unbearable!  It's unpleasantly flowery and smells like an old lady perfume.  Other reviewers seemed to like the scent, so it might just be me.  Scent is a very subjective sense.  I will go back purchasing the one with the blue label.  By the way, the gel itself is great!"

RUS9VSDBHIY9M,This one works!,"Since arriving to my 50's, I've notice changes to my body that were never an issue as a younger person.  One of those issues is toenail health. Who would have thought?  So we go to the pharmacy and try a bottle of whatever they have.  After discovering a certain product didn't work, we try the next one on display, and so on, until we figure out that toenail health is a difficult issue to address with reasonable success. Many products on the market contain what I would call an offensive odor such as eucalyptus or tea tree oil. Never would I want to remove my shoes at friends' home, cuz soon after they would ask: &#34;What's that smell?&#34; Embarrassing to say the least.  So, after countless hours searching the internet, I came upon Keractil. I found myself becoming a repeat customer.  It's my opinion that the test of time makes for the best testimonial. I love it.  It works for me.  I even stopped using it for a while as another test.  I'm convinced. I went right back to using it. And, I have no reservations telling others.  After all, I know what they're going through. Enjoy!"

R2NPNCGM6T1JBA,Beware of fake reviews!,"The main reason I like to use Amazon is that I can decide which product to buy based on the reviews. However, several companies have started taking advantage of that. I've received discounted or even free products before from sites like AMZreviewtrader, and you ALWAYS have to put at the end of your review that you received that product at a discount/for free in exchange for your honest review. If you don't, Amazon will pull that review because they can see that you paid only $2 or $3 for the product instead of full retail value.<br /><br />I was naturally a bit suspicious when I saw that some products by pura d'or have thousands of positive reviews. So I bought this shampoo, thinking maybe the reviewers were right. Now, I have nothing against the shampoo itself. It's made of natural ingredients and it cleans my hair. It dries the heck out of my scalp so I had to slather on layers of conditioner afterwards, but most natural shampoos do that to my hair so it's nothing unexpected. But I have a real problem with the marketing strategy of Pura d'Or. If you look at the review page of their products, you'll see hundreds of reviews that have the same story pattern, and left by reviewers that have only that review under their account.<br /><br />I went through 2 month worth of reviews for the argan oil conditioner (that's 18 pages of review, that's how angry I was), and I lost count but there were at least 3-5 reviews a day that were bogus. They all had very similar stories:<br />1) I'm a *insert job title*, so my look is very important for my job<br />2) I started losing hair/bald spot<br />3) My friend/doctor referred this product to me<br />4) The hair loss stopped after 1 month of use!<br />5) Miracle/unbelievable<br />I actually saw a couple reviews that used the exact same wording. And every couple weeks or so, they would come up with new stories like how their hair was unmanageable (instead of hair loss) but became so silky after using this product and yadiyadah.<br /><br />Most importantly, I know these reviews are bogus because I clicked on each name and saw that the reviewer left only ONE review, and it's the Pura d'Or product review. Sure, it's possible that some reviewers loved this product so much that they decided to leave the first ever product review. But all of them? And anyone that left a review that's less than 3 stars have at least 4 or 5 unhelpful votes. Some of them really weren't helpful reviews, others were talking about how their hair got all tangled after using the product and were quite helpful, but they got negative votes anyway.<br /><br />Everything screamed BS. The story templates, the fake reviewers, the down-voting of reviewers that didn't love their product...shame on you, Pura d'Or. If this isn't against Amazon policy, I don't know what is. All I can do is report abuse to Amazon, vote the bogus reviews as unhelpful, and leave this review to let the buyers know. Maybe I'll get so many negative votes that you'll never see this review. But I can certainly try! It's sad that you can't trust reviews on Amazon anymore. This is really just an average product, and it's certainly not so amazing that it deserves thousands of positive reviews (this one only has a couple hundreds, but it has its fair share of bogus reviews).<br /><br />I do not work for any company. Like I said, I receive free/discounted products from time to time, but they're usually from different companies. All I was required to do in return was leave a review, doesn't have to be a positive one. You can check my profile and you'll know I've reviewed different brands of beauty products. I'm not paid by anyone to slam pura d'or, I just feel like people should know.<br /><br />P.S. The 3 stars are for the product itself, which is only average. If I could leave a separate review for Pura d'or, I would. But the seller is Amazon, so I can't really give them a rating.><br />Most importantly, I know these reviews are bogus because I clicked on each name and saw that the reviewer left only ONE review, and it's the Pura d'Or product review.

R27WUHCY8AHCB6,So far this has been my favorite hair vitamins,"So far this has been my favorite hair vitamins.<br />The nutrients and vitamins that are included here are a lot, it's more like a multivitamin kind of pill, but more focused on the hair growth.<br />I have been taking biotin everyday of my life because i am so prone with hair fall and hair loss.<br />But we all know that biotin is just one of the good stuff that we need to take if we want to grow a healthy and stronger hair.<br />This particular pills includes biotin and all the necessary nutrients and vitamins that helps us grow our hair faster and better.<br />I use to take separate vitamins along with my daily biotin, but now I do not need to that anymore as this is already complete.<br />I love it, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good hair growth supplement.<br />I purchased this using a promo code for testing."

R1OCN923RYUBJO,Perfect Waterpik,This is the perfect size for me.  Its easy to add water if you need more.  So far I have not.  There are 3 power choices.  I use the middle one so more power is available if you need more.  I love the color and the stickers are optional.

I figured for as much it cost it would be in good condition at least. Zero stars did nothing for two weeks after my 13yr old used it. Smells ok separately but really weird all together she mentioned to me also
R2IU4MW5WVKIUM,Loofahs take over bathroom.  Countless casualties in the epidermis.,The &#34;rough&#34; part of the loofah isn't scratchy or rough.  I was kinda hoping for it to be a little scratchy/rough.  It does a great job though.

R1WYWM5JCFSOFV,Filter doesn't last,"My husband and I wanted a really good shower filter and hired a handyman that also was a plumber.  He went on Amazon and purchased this for us because we believe it was the easy way out.  We do not like the orange stick as it stands out like a sore thumb in our bathroom and the filters don't even last four weeks.  Needless to say, he didn't complete all of our work and we realized he was a lousy handyman who also got us a lousy water filter."
R3E7K9LT6Q3M6Z,Good product...shipping was slow,I really like this product it works well and seems to last longer than similar products that I have purchased in the past.<br />My only complaint would be that shipping took a few weeks even with Amazon prime.<br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
R2M25U50PGVJGE,Five Stars,The colors are great and pigmented!

R1RGAN3ESY6V06,Good Deal for the Money,"I used to use DMSO 35 years ago, when it was undiluted, did not smell good and caused a nasty taste in your mouth. But it worked right away for aches and pains.  The company can not even advertise their product as a pain reliever on the jar. It does work but not as well as the straight undiluted version.  With that said it does diminish sore muscle pain and I ordered a number of them to give to friends and relatives....and they say it works for them.<br />So overall I can recommend it.....the price is right, you don't have to use much of it; making a jar last three or four times as long as a Blue Emu or Australian Dream."

What a surprise, this does smell like a cucumber with a tone of melon. The consistence is also thicker. My bathroom is full of serums and this became one of my favorite, just because the scent of it, that is refreshing and pleasant. Such a nice brake from medicinal smelling serums.  I was provided this for evaluation."

R200CTUAGMURKB,The only natural deodorant that actually works! It's magic!,"I have tried almost every natural deodorant on the market, and they all have one thing in common - they stop working after a couple hours. After years of trying different deodorants I was resigned to the fact that I would either have to be stinky all the time or poison myself with an aluminum-based deodorant. Although doubtful I decided to try this one because of the good reviews, and I am SO glad I did, it is amazing!!! Not only does it last for more than a couple hours, but it works well for days, and even in high activity. I would highly recommend this product."
R2Q3ZF4XZQLZ53,sparkly smile,This stuff is great! I am sure to continue to use it- you can tell an immediate difference and my mouth feels so super clean. Best part is it only took 2 minutes!

R49PYRIR5GWBQ,Love love love,First off it looks really nasty but it doesn't taste like anything and it really does work. My teeth look a lot cleaner and it's great if you really don't floss your Teeth because I  don't n after using the product your teeth feel and look a lot cleaner especially in the cracks which is a big help for me because my teeth are stained I highly recommend this product even though it looks and sounds scary it's really not I will be buying again and I gave my mom the sample that they sent to me and she also loves it.

R1QSE8MUZFVXF6,The Xtava Professional Fat Iron is amazing!!!,"My daughter and I love to flat iron are hair and are always looking for a good flat iron that won't damage our hair and will hold up longer than a month or two.<br />I received the Xtava professional flat iron and I was so impressed with the packaging job. It is so nice looking and not cheap like the ones we have had in the past. This one has a 360 degree swivel and a 9 foot cord so it will reach every where I want it to go and I won't have to worry about bending over and trying to reach all of my hair. I have very long hair and it isn't the thickest it has always been,but it is still hard to reach since it is almost touching my rump. I love how long it is. I love the swivel that it gives you so it's easy to move around. I loved how straight my hair got after one run through,yes one. Not a million times.<br />This comes with a LCD display so it is easy to see and you can see how hot it gets . I don't crank it up. I leave it at it's normal temp setting because I don't like it that warm. With that said,my daughter loves it just as much as I do,so we have to take turns on who uses it and who has to wait lol.<br />I received this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased feedback and that is exactly what I have done. Do I think this is a good price?  I really do because you are getting a good quality Flat Iron,not one from a store that is cheaply made:)"

R35FRIBF9A3GRI,"There's no secret here... It's my ""Go To"" brand!!","As a bzzagent I was provided with a free sample of Secret Outlast® Clear Gel from the company to try. I didn't hesitate to sign up for the campaign because Secret is already my go to brand (though I typically prefer to use the Clinical Strength solid). I was a little wary of the protection from a gel deodorant.  In the past, only the clinical strength has seemed to be any protection against sweat stains. I didn't notice much of a different between the protection of this gel and the clinical strength solid I use on a daily basis. The one drawback to the gel is that it's noticeably colder when applying, but an upside is that you don't have to worry about getting those pesky white marks on your shirt... you all know what I'm talking about!"

RL53WDNF0ABFU,Soft Sponges!,I am so glad I found this! I wish I've known about this 3 years ago after my firstborn. I use it now on my 3 year old and 18 month old and I do have to say that sponging them with this is so quick and easy and soft on them. I am going to buy my friend these for her baby shower. Highly recommend these!
R7A2M6AV0NRO2,Awesome moisturizer,Awesome moisturizer
R2VMGRFWD95FVA,Respectable and comfy hair dryer,"I've used several Remington hair dryers over the course of my life and while this isn't my favorite, it's still a quite decent little hair dryer and I'm mainly fond of its size and handle. It fits well in my hand and isn't bulky, rather has a compact feel. There's only two settings, which is somewhat of a downer for me, but at least the basics are covered rather than a mere on/off setting. I love the results of the conditioning ring and highly recommend indulging in it. The heat is good, the power is good. Nothing fancy here, but it's a good little dryer with a handy conditioning option. I also like the brush that comes with this, so that's a nice perk."
R2KYOE22Z6TXTV,thank u herbal essences,I have never had curly hair until I had chemo and lost all my hair which came back curly. If I put nothing in my hair is was frizzy so I was putting in the regular mousse which made my hair sticky and hard. I sent my husband to the store to buy me more mousse and he came back with this on accident which ended up being a blessing. I put it on my hair after taking a shower and when it dries my hair has beautiful curls and feels soft and bouncy. It doesn't weigh down my hair. I absolutely love this stuff and now I can love my curls.
R1EZLAPPF4OSM7,"Arrived in 2 weeks, worth the low price. Better for smaller chest sizes.","Came in 2 weeks, worth the low price. Indeed it is better for smaller chest sizes. My band measurement is 32 inches and the bra is kinda loose, but still works. The fabric is not the best, but I wasn't expecting it to be."
R3J157AM03C45G,Excellent product.,"I purchased this product after prior success. All you do is just put a small dab on the spot and overnight the acne severity decreases. After a couple days of continual use, my face becomes much improved. Much better in my experience than the washes. From the other reviews it's obvious that it doesn't work for everyone but maybe it will work for you! Try it and maybe you will have success like me. The last time I purchased this product it lasted a couple months, hopefully it will last just as long this time around."

But I guess not. It feels good to be noticed in this way and I will keep using this product. I’ve only used it for a handful of treatments too.

RFD24EDF87GSH,Excellent toothpaste,"Great toothpaste! My husband, who hates brushing his teeth, actually looks forward to using this toothpaste!"
R29C889PF7HYLD,Great for travelling!,"These are amazing, we use them on vacation every time. Lotions, shampoo, conditioner, body wash etc...easy to clean, easy to label either with a marker or the built in turn label around the neck of the bottle. Perfect size if you are flying so you are under the legal limit of liquids on board your luggage.<br /><br />I did receive these bottles as a promotional test in exchange for my honest review."
R2J3VLU01V1EJW,Superb,"Perfectly travel sized. The only down side is that it's so small that I lost it, but I can't blame the product. This product is one of the BEST I have used. I'll never go back to cheapie plastic combs again!"

One strange thing is that other presentation, from 50 ml, don't work the same or clouse. My skin doctor don't now the reason, but it is like these."
R1PRYL4SHG9B3N,Excellent performance and cheap price!,"After a few years of enjoying NYX lipsticks, I was delighted by this concealer's performance and value. I bought CW02 and love it; it's quite thick, so a tiny dab is enough for use. My technique is 3 small spots: 1 on eye inner corner and 2 on undereye area, then brush on a little powder. It doesn't settle on creases as much as other concealer brands. Lasts a full workday, from 9am well into 9pm+.<br /><br />Also makes for a great eyeshadow and lipstick primer: make-up stays flawless and in place. I hope product formulas don't change, now that L'Oreal bought NYX."

Great deal, very highly recommended."
R7DZ4PIPZECQ8,Too watery and color is weak,Wouldn't repeat purchase. Not satisfied with product. Underwhelming in performance & color. Doesn't last long in wear.
R34AR4B38R1AUH,"One Application, Two Useful Purposes  . . .  and MORE!","Okay, so I read scores of reviews on a dozen similar products, and Avon's Skin-So-Soft handily took the lead for effectiveness amongst the reviewers.  Now that we ourselves are using it, I can only concur and likewise agree that despite the price, it is well worth its cost.  No question but that Skin-So-Soft is a very effective deterrent for mosquitoes, fire ants, chiggers, etc., while it does a darn good job as a reasonably long-lasting sunscreen for the kiddoes.  One application, two useful purposes.<br /><br />But that's only a portion of the reasons for buying this particular product.  What makes it really different is that it is a lotion which doesn't make skin look nor feel greasy.  It also has a pleasant, light scent --- it's Avon! --- that doesn't get to be too much as the day goes on.  Most important of all, Skin-So-Soft, unlike so many other such products, does NOT BURN EYES whenever pool water or sweat drips down.  Most highly recommended."

RWI6O8I0UF475,Better then expected,"At first when I opened the package some of the product leaked out and got the lable pf the bottle all greased up. So, I figure that the product would be very oily on the skin. Later that day I used it on my face and elbows (because that area tends to be very dry for me). I continued to use it in those areas daily and my skin is very moisturized without feeling oily. I would recommend this 100%"

R1VLKCKW3ZPVY4,Good Sun Protection,Great sun protection for adults and children without the crazy chemicals. As with all zinc oxide products it tends to leave a white residue though I will take this any time over harmful Oxybenzone or Octinoxate that mess with your hormones. This is a great product that is much cheaper than some of the other pediatrician approved creams.

R1ZC5EZS1P4CBV,Good Product,I wanted to wait until I have used this for a while before I wrote the review.  I have been using it on my face daily before my regular moisturizer.  I initially bought it to see if it would help the red areas on face that I believe are rosacea.  I will be honest and say that so far it hasn't helped it but it does make my skin feel better and I feel like some of my lines and crows feet seem less noticeable. I was afraid the oil would make my face break out but so far that hasn't happened.  I also mix a few drops in with Moroccan oil I use on hair.
R1MI0KA95EF889,Five Stars,I really like how my hair looks beautiful brown and shiny

R2RLL9KPEOZA57,Good in theory but has detergents in it.,"I had originally rated this 5 stars until I tried As I Am's Coconut Cowash, which is 10x better. I liked this shampoo bar and still think it is cool. However, I am a little disappointed in it because 1) Apparently (according to the Subreddit r/hairscience) it has detergents in it :/. Makes sense as to why it lathered now. I am trying to grow my hair out. So I do not want the mechanical damage associated with detergents.  2) It worked overall, but it left a few spots of my head greasy no matter how much I worked on the areas. This doesn't bother me like crazy, but it was a little weird.  After using As I Am's Coconut Cowash (which is a cleansing conditioner and has no detergent or soap in it), I am pleasantly surprised at how soft and still clean it left my hair. Apparently without stripping it! My hair also looks much better and is more manageable with the co-wash. The greasiest are gone.   Still a nice product and would be good for travel. It still seemed to soften my hair and scalp. I just feel a little misled. I appreciate what they are going for. Giving this to my boyfriend to use as he keeps his hair short and trims it much more. So damage isn't as much of an issue for him.inutes. Then I make sure to rinse verrrry well. I think the scrubbing and rinsing are key to get this product to work. I follow up by gently combing Aussie's 3 minute miracle through my mid-shaft to ends with a wide toothed comb.<br /><br />I didn't blow dry (as I usually don't these days), and it did take FOREVER to air dry. In fact, it's been about 2 hours since I washed it, and my chin length hair is still not dry (might just be my hair and have nothing to do with the shampoo). However, it feels so soft and manageable! My hair does not feel dry at all. I do not feel any waxy build up as others mentioned. I also did not rinse with ACV. So I don't know what is really different about the experience for me other than the fact that my hair was already used to going without shampoo and used to holding grease.<br /><br />If you are looking something to use in between shampoos or to adjust to this permanently, I think it could work really well. It is really helpful in getting off your shampoo dependency. I actually think I may be able to switch to using only this and conditioner once or twice a week in the near future!"

I love them so much that I'm now growing my hair past my waist."

I would recommend this if your having any issues with acne. I also use this for sties and eye infections. Just make sure you dilute it to 50%. I use coconut oil.

R2LMM4R7BJ4EHM,Magnesium Oil Spray,"I was holding off on writing a review so I could leave an accurate one. I have been using this spray (on my feet, legs and abdomen) every night for a few weeks to go to sleep (faster). I really enjoy this product. I will say the first 3-4 times I used this I got this weird tingling/itching but do not experience that any more. On the back of the bottle on the label it says you may experience this due to your body lacking magnesium or to try their spray with aloe. This oil is like a dry oil it does not leave a oily residue which is nice!"
R2QDTWO20JNDS,Five Stars,good
RI0CSTQRYXVO7,It works very well!,Great product. The wand is much easier to use to achieve loose waves and to avoid an indent from the clasp of a regular curling iron. This wand gets very hot but comes with a glove.
R1C3KFAYPIR3JB,Not What I Ordered,I ordered Camphor but received Cajeput. I did some research on Cajeput and decided to keep it. I will be ordering again because even though it wasn't what I ordered it is still a high quality essential oil that I think will be useful.
R29VNAJFXNK2P7,Not what I expected...,"I bought this  based on reviews and I really wanted to like it...There is nothing special about this shampoo and I have  tried a lot ..kerastase,joico,other l'oreal proffesionel products,biolage,wella professional,goldwell,nioxin and many more.There are many  drugstore shampoo way better than this one with half price.My hair is thin and frizzy and it  feels dry and dull after I use this shampoo and I don't see any improve on my blonde colored hair.I would give it 3 stars but not because of the price.I bought absolute repair conditioner to go with this shampoo and I love it, it saved my hair.I do recommend absolute repair shampoo and conditioner,I have used it for years and my hair feels healthy, shinny and frizz free.Do yourself a favor and spend your money on something else or buy absolute repair."

R2POHYG0NFZTXF,GO DIRECTLY TO COASTAL SCENTS!,"This is a fake, the colours are very very chalky with very little pigment payoff. I own other palettes from coastal scents and they are of a far better quality than the trash I was sent. My God, coastal scents isn't even a high end brand, I never expected to be conned. Don't buy this palette, I would recommend going directly to the coastal scents website. This palette is total crap."
RH0XAGDG4GHBY,I love this product,I love this product. My skin has never looked better. My husband uses it for hair loss and it is actually growing hair on his sparse spots. Wouldn't have believed it unless I saw it with my own eyes!
R1RUNAGNXEWHCT,Turned my hair black,"I purchased this hair color after trying a lot of other brands.  I was hoping to find a color that didn't fade so fast.  Since my hair has turned black after dying it, I am hoping that this color fades extremely fast!  I tried washing it to get it to fade (literally 10 times in the past 2 days), but no such luck.  I hate the color on me and I'm embarrassed sitting here at my desk feeling like everyone is saying, &#34;What the heck did she do to her hair&#34;?  Seriously, they're doing double takes. On the plus side, it did cover all the grey and left my hair very smooth and soft.  Since I'm not happy about the color turning black I'm only giving it a 1 star."

R2AYEAI2VKWE3T,"Yes, it's good to know about and probably will do the Earth a favor.","Yes, I like it and wish it would come in larger bottles for less money, but it's good for me.

R350FPIO15IR5O,It feels good the way it plump up the face.,I do like this night cream😏
RU8FQJU8MOIAJ,"Good enough, but not close enough","This Remington PF7200 electric shaver is decent.  It shaves close, is comfortable to use, easy to clean, relatively easy to charge, and portable.  It has a 30 min charge time, 30 min run time from a single charge, two flexible foils with stainless steel blades for a close and comfortable shave, and pop-up trimmer.  However, it is not as good as my [[ASIN:B009XI6BV2 Remington F7800]]  which has a charging base station, digital battery life indicator, washable head, and 5-minutes quick charge, or even the or even the [[ASIN:B00U0X2T42 Remington F7400]] which has a pivot-and-flex head.  Like the F7400, what I do not like is that I don't know how much charge is left in the battery.  It just starts flashing when it needs to be charged, which I suppose is good enough, but there are electric shavers that display approximately how much power is left.  Unlike the PF7400, this shaver does not shave as close as I would like.  This electric shaver is decent enough, but it does not shave close enough and often I have to shave the same area twice as much to get a decent shave with this one.  The trimmer is a nice feature, which I use to shape my sideburns.<br /><br />If all I had was this Remington PF7200, I would be quite happy with its performance and give it 5-stars.  Having used other (and better) shavers, I cannot give this shaver 5 stars.<br /><br />Product Info:<br />Flex Foil Technology - Foils are spaced apart so that the first foil trims hair closely, then gently stretches the skin so that the second foil can get even closer.<br />Surgical Stainless Steel Blades - Shave quickly and cleanly with the sharp, long-lasting blades housed beneath two durable foils.<br />Pop-Up Detail Trimmer - Trim your beard and side burns for a clean-cut look.<br /><br />Other shortcomings:<br />Not as quiet as the PF7400<br />Not Washable (like the PF7400)<br />Not as close a shave as the PF7400"

R184F3HYLIEV7K,hope i've found the key to combat blackheads,"very very good! i used it with dr bronner's peppermint soap to wash face in the morning and at night. twice a day. it seems to be gentle enough not to cause any irritation. I noticed after a few days that the blackheads around T zone are reduced to very little. i had oily T zone, large pores and lots of blackheads. i didn't expect this sponge could be so effective because i've tried so many things in the past: charcoal sugar scrub, bentonite clay, egg white mask, BHA 1%, chemical peels, ultrasonic facial brush, apple cider vinegar, tea tree oil, oil cleansing ... i was desperate and didn't think anything could actually work. but this sponge seems to be working. i've only used it for a little over a week and i will keep using it and see if it is indeed my life changer ... keep my fingers crossed. this is my only hope for now. i will start PMD microdermabrasion soon and hope that will help with uneven skin tone etc."

It makes my skin look healthier and I have no adverse effects applying additional moisturizer with sunscreen on top of it (after I let it absorb into my skin for several minutes). Retinol makes your skin more sensitive to sun, so spf is a must. I do wish this had it, but I'm glad I can apply it on top of it without changing its effectiveness."

R9K09KR6ONIQG,I've found my forever deodorant,"Pros<br />#1: Decreased the amount of redness and peeling to my armpits that I had experienced with the regular unscented version. Armpit skin is almost back to normal.<br />#2: Effectively controls odor.<br />Overall, it works great! I've found my forever deodorant.<br /><br />Con<br />Somewhat gritty. When applying the pit paste, some of the product falls from my armpit to the floor before I can rub it in."
RIEP5QXMEAULG,Five Stars,great value
R39PLZ8WY96WSZ,Lovely,"The eye pillow looks exactly as pictured which surprised me because the colors looked so vibrant for the price. I got the dark blue pillow and it matches the image perfectly. I love lavender eye pillows, they really improve my sleep at night when I struggle getting to bed on time. The scent is soothing and not over powering. It's become a staple at night.<br /><br />Full Disclosure: I received this sample for free for testing and reviewing purposes. My review is 100% honest and unbiased."

R4LE4CB77QJ9P,Five Stars,love it
R14LGVBE44FFR8,Great shaver !!,"Great shaver.  Does a good job giving you a smooth shave, and is low maintenance.  Unfortunately, after each use, it requires cleaning in the included cleaning system.  Unfortunately, it runs through the cleaning solution very quickly and the replacement fluid module is expensive.  The main cost is in the actual plastic fluid container.  They should offer a large size fluid only bottle to refill your cleaning module, then they can sell it at a more reasonable price.  The shaver itself is quite expensive, so they should give you some sort of break on replacement supplies."
R2T9AWQASM8C7N,Perfect travel tolietry kit!!,"Perfect for traveling, and the zipper quality is far superior to my last designer toiletry kit. I'm looking forward to seeing future products from this brand!"

R3FW38FLYPBR2R,My daughter loved it! Thanks,Yes. My daughter loved it! Thanks
R2N0Y3B03P43D3,Amazing. You really need to have this.,"The set contains the total of three tan applicators. One big, regular size glove, that fits your hand is 8 1/4 inch by 5 inch, two small ones, to be used on fingers, measure 3 1/8 inch by 2 1/4 inch each. The dimensions of the package is 9 3/4 by 6 1/8, in case anyone wanted to get this for a gift and wondered. The fabric on applicators vary by size. The bigger one is made of a blanket alike, brown, extremely plushy plush, the same on both sides. There is also a foil all around the inside, that keeps you from getting your hand stained. Smaller applicators are designed to handle a detailed tanning work, preferably on face, the outside plush is slightly different on one side, and there is a stretch fabric on the other, foil is only on one inside part, but this is enough. I find the brown color to be perfect for such an invention, the remaining tan is not visible on the gloves. Please note, that this is a top quality product. From what I saw on the profile pictures, I probably would have not ordered this, it looks way better in real.<br /><br />As for how this works. It usually takes me about 20 minutes to put a fake tan all over my body and face, using my hands. I use a light in consistence tanner as a base, and Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs in Deep shade as the primary cream. The latter one is a thick cream and insanely hard to use, not even evenly use, but to use at all. With this applicators, I am having a blast, any tanner smoothes on my skin like a lotion. I always hated how long it takes and the stains on my hands, fingers and under finger nails, that were almost impossible to quickly wash off, when I was all ready to leave the house. With this applicators my time shorted in half by the first use, I am certain that I can get faster with practice. My hands are perfectly clean, this does not let any tan cream to get to the inside of the applicator. It puts tan incredibly smoothly, I would have never thought, that this was even possible. The tan looks even, I mean very - very - even. I personally was so thrilled with short application time, that I did not think, that there will be any difference in how my skin will look, because how could this be. My friend, however, noticed the difference in my appearance right away and asked me, what did I do with my face, because it looks so fresh and even, like never before. The answer is, you can use any tanner, with this set, it will look incredible. I would have gotten this years ago, if I only knew.<br /><br />I wash it by hands in warm water with soap, and hang it in my bathroom to dry over night. I am not sure, if this can be put in a washing machine, I am afraid the fake tan could stain my other clothes, and I don`t know if this product can be washed, as it is made partially of foil. if someone tries it, please comment.<br /><br />I received a sample for evaluation. It does not affect my opinion, I rate this product at 5+. If it was easier to wash this, I would give it 6 stars.<br /><br />* As I have been using this great product, I would like to add a tip for manufacturer. I suggest attaching a loop also to at least one mini applicator, there is no way to hang it in its current shape and its unnecessarily taking space on my small sink when it`s drying.even.

R2ZPDQLKADI4IQ,My hairdresser recommended this product,My hairdresser recommended this product.  No more breakage!!!<br /> Absolutely love it!!!!
R2PHL3MZWOROSX,nope,I tried and I didn't to much care for it. I am a multi racial female. I'm African American and Irish and this stuff dlline of Shea moistures does nothing for my hair.
R11IS7G8M0EO32,Dove is the best,This product is several of anti perspiration products I tried. This came up tops in terms of not leaving  white marks and lasting long. My search is over
R17G6S5ZV4DHKN,Scent-free and light,Just started using it. I like how my skin feels after each use. It's scent free and very light. Does not feel greasy and heavy at all. Only time will tell if this product will &#34;repair&#34; my skin as it promises to.
R3FYYZ1Z81REHB,Five Stars,the textured it good and it would buy it again but only from the seller Esee Beauty
RCL7VPAO52LH7,Facelift,Most excellent. It looks better than the original.
R2FOX6KU0NIE4E,BEST I'VE EVER USED!,"It smells GREAT!!!! And leaves my hair easy to comb, and soft. I have very fine hair, but a lot of it, and it is very easy to tangle. This is the best leave-in conditioner I have used. I will be buying this again and again."

R3EFBURQAJU8WH,Five Stars,Works well
R16W083PZFS33Q,and I'm pretty sure this is gonna work just fine,"Ordered 3 of these.  1 for me and 1 each for my daughters. They are a generous size so I can just pick it up and switch it to whatever large purse I want to use.  I even looked at a quilted tote bag recently and was thinking I could use it as a purse as long as I had one of these to corale all my stuff. I need something to hold a makeup bag, general papers bag (meds lists, receipts, stamps coupons, etc.), large wallet, house keys, tissues, otc meds box, cell phone, pens, etc. and I'm pretty sure this is gonna work just fine!"
R13OCMDI5LUMWW,My absolute favorite body brush!,"If you love dry brushing you will love this one. One warning though, it is not for the faint of heart since it does not take prisoners. If you want an exfoliation, that's what it will deliver. And boy, does it feel good when your circulation gets going. It's my favorite part of the day when I get out the brush before stepping into the shower and come out refreshed and squeaky clean. By the way: No more ingrown hairs, firmer skin, less coffee necessary to wake up and the pleasant feeling that I bought a really good product for a fair price."
R11SE2PZP2E3N1,Five Stars,Great thank u great price
RIHUKO18RR9R6,Five Stars,very good
R1ZLEQ8O62N9FV,It's like a dark punk pink,"I asked for light pink and this lipstick wasn't definitely that. It's like a dark punk pink, I didn't like it at all. Wrong item."
RESMIZ3IQD5OT,"Nice Presentation, Nice Taste, But.....","My first impression of the product was that I really liked the packaging (packaging is a big factor in my purchase). I loved that the two tubes came in one package.<br />I love the taste - not too &#34;stingy&#34;.<br />What I didn't like after using the product for a while now - is the time it takes you to brush. If you follow the directions properly and are really motivated to get a whiter smile - you have to commit 2 minutes to the brush. Doesn't sound like a lot but truthfully when I'm tired and want to go to bed, I just want to brush. I found myself using my &#34;regular&#34; toothpaste at night and the whitening toothpast (the two tubes) in the morning when I felt refreshed and more willing to commit the full two minutes.<br />I also didn't like the way my gums would feel after using it twice a day every day. Too much on the gums.<br />[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]"
R1NCALHOWCCT8B,Four Stars,Very good smell and keep my skin very smooth.
R247I472RQFWOL,I love this stuff,I love this stuff. And the bottle is larger than I have been able to purchase in drug stores - or seems so.
R14UESP2RWM45N,I am so happy I bought this product,"I am so happy I bought this product!! I received my order very fast and it came with an unexpected gift, an organic Rose hip oil bottle and that was not all, the owner of the company sent a very beautiful thank you card with all these, what a nice personal detail!!! So far I have not used the glycolic acid but as soon as I try it I will let know my results, also I plan to use the oil to make a face cream and use it as a primer, so may uses!!! I am definitely so excited to start using my products, also planning on buying more products from this store.  I highly recommend this for the excellent service and the quality of the products. Thank you Purely Radiant Store"
R2GNLDI7NAAKKU,Five Stars,I like the size an this product has really helped my sagging neck look firmer.
R25EAPO7ZZ0UHC,"Softening, and all natural!","I was sent a sample size of this product for review.<br /><br />I am in love with this scrub! I was immediately excited to read the ingredients on the label of this scrub - there's only a small handful, and the list only includes salt, shea butter, and essential oils. A product doesn't get much more natural than that!<br /><br />The smell is nice, and unique. The scrub itself is a light pink, reflective of the pink Himalayan sea salt in the scrub. The full size comes with a scooper for application, which would certainly be easier than using your fingers.<br /><br />This is different from other scrubs I've used in that the &#34;scrub&#34; component melts away as you scrub. It rinses easily, but leaves behind a moisturizing layer of oil. For this reason, this may feel too heavy in the summer time - but would be perfect for dry, winter skin. I don't even feel the need for lotion after using this, which is amazing for an exfoliating product. My skin felt soft after using, and retained a light, pleasant smell.<br /><br />The scrub is marketed as an enhancement to the company's cleanse, and exfoliation can certainly help the detox process. However, even if you're not on a cleanse, this is a great product to combine once or twice a week with dry brushing."

R30MXIC3RLFEE0,Five Stars,I love this stuff. I have used it for a long time.
R3VJCOJ3U3LWHO,You must have this!,"This shampoo and conditioner actually makes my hair feel like hair, rather than a nasty bale of hay. It's the only product I use now!"

R1Z9RD3HK9TBD1,Not What I Expected,"Based on the photo, I thought this base coat would be white in color, but it was clear. Seeing as how I bought it to make lighter colors pop, it wasn't really what I needed. Still a good base coat, though."
RRA5J7LQ66K1I,Product arrived old/expired .,"Pretty sure the item was expired.. I've used this brand a few times and im aware it has a strong odor and color tint ect .. but this certain can sprayed out dark green glob like uneven foamy clumps that smelled horrible like nail polish remover . I tried one spot just to see if maybe it was just the solution being to shaken ect.. but no , it didn't even tan my skin . 99.99 % sure the product was way expired ."
R2PM0D2TM707R1,doesn't work much better than cheaper ones I've had,"Nothing special honestly, doesn't work much better than cheaper ones I've had. But I have fairly straight hair so my hair doesn't require special straightening."
R2WWUYPMM7YEXJ,Definitely Recommended!,"This mask feels, smells and works great! After one use my face felt cleaner, less oily and refreshed. In my opinion, a lot of masks have an &#34;institutional&#34; smell to them, like they came from a hospital or something. Aria Starr mask smells like roses no joke! If you're in the market for a product that works and isn't full of chemicals you can't pronounce, then this mask will be worth your time and money."
R37LA30UOFUHOH,Works well-great for braces,My son uses this for his braces to get the extras out.  Seems to work well
R2NNVC0TU6ICUT,Best stuff for Poopourri,"Love these, use them for my homemade Poopourri. Yep, poop-pourri. Stuff you spray in the toilet before you poop and it makes it smell like tropical bliss! I live with three boys, this stuff is freaking magic!"
R1KE3T2P2NF9SS,It’s very easy to just stick it in and use for fifteen ...,Strips are a hassle and the trays stay in my mouth. It’s very easy to just stick it in and use for fifteen minutes and then take it out. So simple to use. Enjoy using this product.

R6U0G8SCREXPY,My favorite bath poufs,"I got tired of buying these one by one at Walmart and decided to buy in bulk. They last for ever, which means I won't be buying more for quite a few years to come."
R26EJOSSKHX2LK,Good buy.,Worked good. Heats up like its suppose to but I haven't been consistent enough to see a change. But I think it's a good buy.
R2QJOJ3IFTM72O,Supreme,"This is a creamy gel formulation.  Non drying or caking like some &#34;gels&#34;. Applies smoothly, evenly and easily absorbed.  Love it so far, too soon to notice a difference.  Very happy that the ingredients are as listed - honesty is greatly appreciated!"

R3O2SXOKC1LVCO,Great products at a great price.,These replacement heads  are just as good as the high priced Phillips heads at half the price.  We have also ordered other Sonimart brush products and found them to be fantastic. We'll never buy another brand.  I highly recommend these Sonimart products.
R11AUY8CP370NV,great accessories,"Wasn't expecting these to be as heavy as they were but they are beautiful rings! Definitely a stronger quality. There's 5 different colors and several different sizes and shapes. Each ring is unique. Plus there's a variety of sizes! Shipping was fast too.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my unbiased, honest opinion and reveiw"
R2QSEYMP7RUGC7,Five Stars,COOL GROOVY AND FAROUT
R3JAKX2DEQ6A9C,The fit is doable and can be ok in a pinch but the sound is terrible when your not used to it,"I thought it was the same as I currently use, but was wrong. The fit is doable and can be ok in a pinch but the sound is terrible when your not used to it. I have tried even putting in earplugs and it is still to loud. What is causing the noise is that the air holes are in the front of the mask itself not on the curved front piece where my current one has air holes, that causes a loud noise when the air releases from your exhale. If you are ok with the loud air noise and less cushioning, this is ok to choose. I cannot use it and will only have it for an extreme emergency back-up now, sad waste of money because I did not look at the picture closer and realize the holes are in an odd place."
R3OIWWSZM52TDF,Five Stars,What a great brush to have. I love the size and it's durability.
RPCOP77Q8G39X,and not only did they have a horrible chemical smell when we opened the package,"I bought these as a gift for my little sister, and not only did they have a horrible chemical smell when we opened the package, but one unraveled after the first use. I was later informed you can purchase the same product, at a higher quality, for $2 a piece at target. So I highly recommend saving your money."
RG0AIEZFWITB6,Five Stars,"So cute, exactly what I expected!"
R2E5V02NV59L0M,some will also enjoy the smell while others won't,"The fragrance is lovely. Since the olfactory is as varied as the person, some will also enjoy the smell while others won't.  I find it Delightful!  Very happy for the find. The moisturizing and healing claims seem to hold true. It's just a great surprise to find this product."
R3QTJC8XOOLZC6,Doesn't last as long as I would like it too (3-5Hrs) but that probably has something to ...,"Doesn't last as long as I would like it too (3-5Hrs) but that probably has something to do with how much I apply (Once in the front, once in the back, and the occasional neck when I'm feeling naughty). The smell is pleasant though and is the reason why I would not mind buying it again in 1 or 2 (hopefully) years.<br />Also: BE AWARE OF KNOCKOFFS"
R24ICVWIAHP23S,Got two one for my mom and one for me ...,Got two one for my mom and one for me .. It worked on my mom and not on me.. but at least she can keep both.
RPJWGOC2DUXM3,Great product for sensitive skin with an amazing smell!,"This shaving cream is great for sensitive skin in the fact the fragrance is not too strong. If you have sensitive skin like me, most scented shaving creams tend to irritate my skin and cause a burning sensation while shaving. If using some type of brush, whether badger or boar hair, you only need a pea size amount to produce a lather good enough for two to three passes.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this is the amount of lather and the cushion it provides. With this cream, I've noticed I'm less prone to razor burn in sensitive areas, especially in the neck area.<br /><br />As far as the fragrance goes, my wife says it reminds her of lavender, but I disagree. It's really hard to describe the scent, but the great thing is it's not overpowering and feminine.<br /><br />In regards to the size of the tube, this is the perfect size for traveling. I find the tubs to be rather bulky, but not this. If shaving on a daily basis and using a good brush, I've gotten a tube like this to last almost three months."
R1B3XLFZG9K4U6,Five Stars,Great razors!

R2LKE9BNZ3ZGRO,"Very sharp, nicely adjustable, small thumb opening.","Very sharp, nicely adjustable, nice case. But be aware, the opening for your thumb is on the smaller side.  It might be uncomfortable for a larger hand."
R3JVPDO6XSMUPU,Meh,"Clean but very thin and tight fabric, I was a little disappointed because I thought there would be something setting these apart from a typical pair of woolen gloves. They are constructed better and made out of a nice fabric but I feel as though it simply absorbs any moisture instead of actually locking moisture on my hands."
R2LTY9FXV45SFQ,Four Stars,The price is good.
R2J9GV4XE022C1,perfect gel,"I tried this at my salon and really looked great with very little gum. Also, comparatively it's pretty cheap, except that it's not shipped by amazon and shipping fees is too much. I might try looking for it somewhere in-store."

I hadn't squeezed it, I had done nothing to  make it just spit out a half dollar  sized amount of the product.  It just poured out.<br /><br />I don't  care for the smell, it reminded me of  a household  cleaner. It made me cough  a little and my skin burn until I cleaned  it  off.<br /><br /> My skin feels softer and grease - free after first use. But it does stink.<br /><br />I received  this  product  at  a  discount  in  exchange  for  my honest  review."

R24Q6K4T0VHU8W,Refreshing,Gentle and effective. As a busy mom I don't have time to wash my face. I use this instead. I feel clean but not overly dry. I don't wear mameup though so can't speak to that.

R2NXREY68ZUB3M,Good mask smells funny but not in a bad way!,"Great mask for the price, I tried it only once it left my skin softer but not as I expected. I do have a sensitive oily and acne prone skin, but will continue to use."
R301T3TH10S1EB,Best clock I ever had,"Yes, at first it was aggravating to have to remove the back of the clock for every setting, but the longevity has more than compensated for that.  I was given one of these clocks as a gift approximately 19 years ago and even though it has been knocked on the floor several times, it still works perfectly.  I admit every time it lands on the floor, everything has to be reset, but it has been too reliable for me to complain.  Best clock I ever had."

So sad about that, so I will have to try another<br />perfume.  I used to really love this scent!  :("
R3JV15ISMIYYQI,"My wife likes it, but it smells odd","I got this for my wife. She likes using it, but I think it has an odd scent that I don't particularly enjoy. Looking forward to when it's all used up so she can go back to regular, scent-free soap."

R33L2T7Z21UNWG,48 hour Protection,My favorite deodorant that last 48 hours. Outlast during the 90 degree summer days plus humidity. It leaves no white residue on my shirts and is completely clear. I recieved a sample thanks to secret.
R1ZVSRP0IYJINC,NOPE,this curling iron is definitely not meant for long hair.... I have long hair and I tried a bunch of different styles that I saw on YouTube that you could do with these curling irons and they turned out terrible. Maybe if I had a bigger barrel but this one is not meant for us long haired gals.
R1LUS1NZ9DCLV7,Five Stars,Love it for taming the frizz.
R1559UR4PZEPHW,Would be 5-star product if it didn't rip when peeling from sheet,Lovely but the polish almost never peels whole from the sheet -- annoying to have it rip all the time. Goes against the idea of ease and simplicity.
R1BA981WGXD5RO,Two Stars,Too small for most things to be useful
R19AZS0K6HN0BF,Good - cinnamony,"Decent, quite a strong flavor. One can taste the underlying cinnamon, it's like a punch to the tongue, but in a good way. It does make my mouth feel fresher. It certainly feels better than alcohol based mouth washes which temporarily feel good then seem to leave the mouth dead, and worse later."

R1HAXDHLP2P4VC,Love the colors,Love the colors and I've never gone wrong with these hair ties.  Didn't realize there were so many (I guess I should have paid closer attention) so I guess I'll be splitting them and using them as stocking stuffers.

So I mixed the two together to see how it felt.  It felt good while sitting on my hair and after sitting under the dryer but after I washed it out my hair felt dry...and the SMELL  of the Silicon mix is way to strong  for me, and it lingers for days....maybe I tried the wrong formula  because so many people are raving about this combo...I don't know"

R35IB6G1BV7HOI,ehh not the greatest,not my favorite hair conditioning product. Does not leave my hair super soft and easy to manage. Maybe my hair is too processed but I definitely need something that adds more moisture to my hair. I would not order again.
R3ITLBBBMD7IKN,buy it,this stuff is incredible - that's all I have to say - buy it
RDGG1O936FVUV,At last! A product that REALLY WORKS,"While I have never had very thick hair and it is baby fine, I have had several health issues that have caused my hair to fall out.  Most recently, I had surgery, after which I lost about half of my hair over a 6 month period.  In the last couple of years, I have tried at least 15 products that either didn't work at all or very little to help hair growth.  I also took a daily pill for 9 months that promised hair growth.  All that did was make what little hair I had grow longer, faster.  But when I tried DermaChange, the hair loss nearly stopped within a week and it is now growing in much better.  I used to lose a handful of hair every day in the shower.  Now when I apply the shampoo and conditioner , I see maybe 2-3 hairs on my hands.  And my hairdresser cannot believe the difference!  FINALLY a product that WORKS.  I LOVE this product!!!!"
R2LUG80DSCIY0W,Amazing!!,"These are some of the best makeup brushes I've ever used! They're soft, they make applying makeup so easy, and the price is amazing. They do shed a little, but for the price I can deal. I'll never buy another brush set again."
R1HS7746F281ZI,I switched to BB cream/foundation now but before that out of all my years of trying different liquid foundations this one was my,"Used this because all makeup seems to break me out, after using this my breakouts stopped. The coverage I'd say is medium but its not cakey looking and it looks more natural. Only issue I saw over time is that it made my skin look kinda dry on my face. I switched to BB cream/foundation now but before that out of all my years of trying different liquid foundations this one was my favorite."

RDDSXWDOVC6B9,Great sunscreen for sensitive skin,"I was outside for two LONG days this weekend working in the garden and never got a sunburn!<br /><br />Great sunscreen. Creamy and moisturizing, but not sticky or greasy. I especially like it for the delicate skin of the face -- especially for sensitive skin. Plus, it's not tested on animals, which I LOVE.<br /><br />It has some unusual ingredients like seaweed and algae. Plus, it contains orchid extract, which I researched because I had never heard of it being used in beauty products before. One study I located (H&PC, 2012) found that &#34;orchid oil may help to boost UVB protection significantly when used in conjunction with a sunscreen.&#34;"

R2Z6FGGU3VNCT2,NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN,"I used these and within 24 hours had a severe allergic reaction that I've never had before to any skin products. My skin broke out in red, itchy bumps  anywhere it made contact with these wipes, even on my eyelids and especially around my mouth. I have no idea what I could be allergic to in these wipes since this has never happened before, but my skin is somewhat sensitive to skin products. I currently use CeraVe face moisturizer, which is very gentle on my skin but maybe something about the combination of the two could have caused this reaction? I'm not sure, but I would strongly caution anyone with sensitive skin against these wipes. The red itchy bumps took about a week to clear up and thankfully didn't leave any scars."

R3VIUZ5MQYKF48,Can't beat the price.,You cannot beat the price. I would put these blades side by side with German blades.  If you have a super tough beard you can figure four to five shaves with one blade. Figuring cost at .15 a blade these are very economical.

R20SYBA3O3RZE9,Hair Color Gone Wrong!,This powdery product came out thick and turned the human virgin non color treated blonde hair green! I do not recommend this product!
R3O6V6RXG36KP9,and I love that the end result looks so natural,"As someone who has never used a brow pencil before, this is a daily make-up routine game changer. So simple to apply, and I love that the end result looks so natural!  You literally cannot mess up applying this product!  Just blend with the brush end."

R2SSUVE68A8WVP,"Great, economical solution to night grinding","I not only have a serious night grinding problem, but genetically weak / thin enamel to boot, so while I was in the market for a night guard, boil-able styles such as [[ASIN:B0036WTV2C The Doctor's NightGuard Advanced Comfort Dental Protector for Teeth Grinding, 1 pack]] were not only extremely uncomfortable (to the point where I would get blisters on my gums, and often spit the guard out in my sleep and would wake up to find it on the pillow next to me.) As my dentist explained to me, because of their large size and design in which they mold around all of the teeth, they inhibit the natural flow of saliva at night, which actually helps to prevent cavities.<br /><br />In contrast, this style of night guard is not only extremely comfortable - it is minimalist and gives just the right amount of protection; it's also budget-friendly, easy to sterilize, transport, etc. Proof positive for me was when my dentist confirmed that I'd halted the toll that grinding was taking on my molars *and* that I wasn't presenting with new cavities due to the dry nighttime environment that my previous night guard had been causing. I've found my night guard for life."
R2O993B5YJ4KVH,Love love love the color but be aware how long it might have sat in a warehouse somewhere!,"I received this product and hated it. The color is fantastic! I wish the polish was better quality. I don't know if it's because it was sitting in the warehouse too long but it was almost like a glue sticky substance. I must have tried to paint my nails with 3 different base coats, no base coat and two different top coats before I threw it in the trash! However, when I tried to get a refund, they don't allow returns of nail polish (considered hazardous material and needs special packaging, which is funny because mine just came in a regular box). Amazon is amazing as always because when I reached out to them, they refunded me the nail polish anyways!"
RK8AFVJNWBMEG,Great product!,It works very well! Great product!
R5YL3QMXQ3BYK,The best to use!,Love this! I make my own serum and use it everyday. I love that it comes from Washington and that it is L-ascorbic acid!

R15GO70SNHYEYL,I really like this serum,"I really like this serum! It's the only one I have been able to use during the day, under my make-up.  I have very oily skin, and this serum is very light...not tacky feeling at all.  It absorbs all the way.  If anything, I think it helps reduce the oil production.  It definitely helps to make pores seem smaller.  I think it helps my make-up last longer as well.  I like being able to put something so beneficial under my make-up.  I used similar serums prior to getting this one, so I can't say that I've seen huge changes in my overall skin appearance.  Again I think it's because I already used products with these ingredients.  I will continue to purchase this product when I run out!"
R2CDRTPE0A3CGM,Five Stars,I buy this for my daughter. She loves it.
R28DOHM9OTKS8,I love this stuff,"I love this stuff. I start the day with Soapwalla Deodorant Cream and follow with 2 sprays of the Weleda Citrus Deodorant, and this works well for me. The spray can be used as needed to freshen up as well. Both brands have a citrus scent available that compliment each other."

R2BHKGFWSPYV9W,Great long lasting color,This is my favorite hair dye.  It really is only 10 minutes.  The color is rich and looks great.  My hair doesn't get dried out and I love the conditioner it comes with.  I've been using this product for a long time and have been completely satisfied.

RL7Y4BFEQLJ0W,Best lotion on the market,Best lotion on the market!  Original scent is far and away the best...stay away from the watermelon scent as it smells like a dirty dishrag.
R2MYTB17SP8Z69,It had many features I liked (larger capacity,"I did so much research before buying this diffuser. It had many features I liked (larger capacity, could handle citrus oils). The top is a little hard to put back on as others expressed. Wasn't a total deal breaker though. The output was good and I could easily smell the oils. The lights work and are pretty. My issue is that I started to feel ill just after turning it on. I had nausea and light headedness and it got worse as the unit stayed on. I started to wonder after using it again the next day if it was the ionizer in the unit that was making me feel sick. So I did a quick google search and found that the ozone ionizers make can cause people to feel sick (my symptoms) and it's actually not very good for you at all. In the questions some ask about the ionizer and people have responded regarding the mist output (showing that most people probably don't even know what the ionizer is). The ionizer has nothing to do with mist output. The ionizer puts out negative ions that are supposed to clean the air. However, as a byproduct they produce ozone (think bad air quality). It can be very dangerous for those with breathing or lung issues. I will look for another unit that does not include an ionizer and I would suggest you look up what ionizers are before getting this unit to be sure it's something you want in your home."
RFQ2LTAJHCPP4,Works great,Really cuts down on hair drying time. Planning on buying a couple more.

You won't smell of perfume the whole day, but I find that if you are involved in physical activity (including one involving ladies) the scent comes to life again and  it will earn you very favorable comments."

R32EKILOM5NGL,Great lash glue,"Has a learning curve in the beginning but as long as you let it get tacky before applying and don't use too much, your lashes will last all day"
R10A7EPUE87LVS,Really like it so far,"Have only been using it for a couple of weeks, but I have already noticed a few positive changes. Inflammation (red or blotchy areas), as well as breakouts have diminished. This is really potent stuff. Really like it so far!"

RURC93BKZM0AE,Five Stars,Like it very much.
R10HETQ6K7RIRT,so far so good,"I received fairly quickly, I just started using the product last night, and What I like about it so far is, there isnt an over whelming smell, and it has a nice texture, I am using it for my lashes and brows, and I like when applying it doesnt drip all over. I plan on editing my review after one week and then one month to say if it does increase length and thickness."
R3SJKYX0SB4X7U,"These are a nice size, especially for my grandson","These are a nice size, especially for my grandson.  They are very soft and the microfiber is a great texture.  They wash up very nicely but you have to remember, as with all microfiber, don't use laundry softner."

R1SH9WWE8ALCCR,What a waste!,"Very small and a piece of junk. Don't waste your money. Leans to the right, barely stands on its own let alone put a piece of jewelry on it! I gave 1 star only because I had to."
R1LZR6ZOLNBY0C,This is a great acne product,"This is a great acne product! Although, I was looking for a more natural face wash and stumbled across this product in a store (this company is all online now so you will not find it in stores). I have fair skin and sometimes terrible break outs on my face. This product has never let me down, usually clearing up my acne within a day or two. I do not use it everyday, just when I have breakouts. I am not a male so not really sure if the female specific product would work better but I am very happy with this! I thought it a little on the expensive side but will pay extra for a product that works."
R2RCVLA02WE3OY,Five Stars,Works great
R3LZ0VTUK57R7T,Five Stars,It works.
R33M7SFFL6UE9E,Did Not Disappoint,"I am a long time user of Phyto hair products and have always liked their shampoos and conditioners. This is the first styling product I've tried from PHYTO and it is excellent. It leaves the hair shiny and styled, without tackiness, and the style holds pretty much the entire day. You would only need to use a very small amount so the jar will last quite a while."
ROKKNSYUFDGO1,2nd time lucky!,Bought it for my son to replace an older one. He loves it. That's good enough for me.
R1FDYK3J88OC97,I like this one!,Like this a lot. A little goes a long way. Love how it's. It as harsh as the original one. Feels great on skin and washes off clean.
R1WGQO3RE86QXB,Easy and Effective Whitening System,"This is an easy two step toothpaste system to get your teeth white along with daily brushing.  The first step is a deep cleansing toothpaste containing fluoride that removes stains like coffee, tea, wine etc from your teeth. this is used for one minute. Then without rinsing you use the second step, again for one minute, which is a whitening finisher in gel form which contains hydrogen peroxide.  I've been using this system twice a day for about two weeks. I like it. I have noticed whiter teeth, but more importantly I have had minimal sensitivity. Works fast and no waiting like the strips. Just brush and go makes it easy for daily use for any busy person with great results."
RV8TR0SLOZCRE,Great product,Great product
R1DU67X81LMIYH,Very lightweight,I have only been using for a few days but so far it seems great.. I like the feeling of the lightweight gel. Most gels are sticky or dry hard. This does not.
R13PDCEK940M9O,Noticeable Difference,"I've read a few of the negative reviews accusing the positive ones of being paid for. I really wish I was a paid reviewer because this product is pretty expensive. However, after a month of using it, my hair definitely has more body to it and all the trouble spots that were clearly going bald have filled in because of it. I must say I wasn't full blown bald, just starting to notice much thinner hair and receding spots. I still haven't noticed any new growth but the hair overall looks much fuller so it gives the appearance that new hair has grown. I'll definitely update when I've hit the 90 day mark. I'm not going to say this will do wonders for everyone but it certainly has done a lot in the short time I've used it and my confidence is way up. Even my barber noticed a change, which to me is a great test. I'd say it's worth trying a bottle or two if you're having doubts."
R2VQAYFU9IEGM2,I have been buying a hearty supply from this wonderful company for some time now & am spoiled by ...,"I have been buying a hearty supply from this wonderful company for some time now & am spoiled by the way they make you look! They are easy to use,just make sure your skin has been cleaned of oils with some alcohol 1st.To assure they keep my face lifted,I place a paper tape strip to cover over one end of the tape to the other (you can get this tape at Walgreens & keeps gauze bandages on.)  I keep shopping at CosmeSearch,since they give me great enough service & product that I have no need to look further."
RW2CDZNB8VN3T,I hate whitening products because they just hurt my teeth and ...,finally found a product that actually got rid of my coffee stained teeth. I hate whitening products because they just hurt my teeth and don't whiten within a reasonable timeframe but this one really works
R2RLXEVQS4ZY1M,Easy to Use,"I've never used a flatiron before but this is EASY & if I can make my difficult to style hair look good, any one can.  Very nicely boxed, shipped, and delivered. the cloth travel bag is handy."
R171J9TX4UCRTC,Great products in a cheap package,"W7 is a British company and it shipped from the U.K. by the Royal Mail. I can’t remember exactly, but I got them somewhere between 8-10 days, a much briefer arrival time than the estimated arrival date. Price: A+ Although I like the cute tin, it is not the best quality. Two of the 5 palettes arrived with one of the little hinge pins on the back either missing or broken. I really don’t get upset about this flaw in the packaging for two reasons. First, these are not high-end items, and I know that you get what pay for. Second, I am simply not going to send this item back to the U.K. for a replacement, especially since a new one could arrive just as damaged, if not more so. The wonky lid is inconvenient, but no biggie to me. Some reviews mentioned an off smell, and I did notice that on one of the palettes (don’t remember which one). I guess whatever chemical process is used for the tins sometimes has a lingering odor, but it disappeared pretty quickly after I unpacked it & placed it in my makeup cabinet. I think it “off-gassed” within a few hours, if I remember right. Again, these are not high-end items, and the odor didn’t bother me. Packaging: C- As for the color pay-off, I was pleased with how nicely these shadows looked. I did have to pat them on to get the best color rather that brush them on, but I do that with most shadows, so that is fine with me. They blended out well and there was very little fall out. I also was very pleased at the end of the day when I would wash my face and my eye makeup would look almost exactly the same way as when I put it on that morning, even in the 100 degree plus days that we have had recently. Color, ease of use, and lasting through the day: A"

R2IQ42105WCZPL,Beautiful color changing mood Gel Polish!,"Love, love love the color. I take it to a salon to have them put it on as I didn't want to get the UV lamp thing to cure them. This is gel polish that REQUIRES a UV lamp to cure. It changes color, Purple when cold, Med blue when warm. I get tons and tons of compliments on the color."
R1VGLL33B43BPG,Don't buy this,"I got it in the mail two days early yes , but the quality of the belly ring is SOO CHEAP like almost plastic feeling .. It doesn't look right either .. Don't waste your money .. The pictures make it look amazing .. 😒 yeah right . I'm a regular Amazon buyer and there products over all are cheap ... Whatever not getting anymore of my money !"
R2FQAKVCZJ73E,This brush is fantastic. You can cut your time in half from ...,This brush is fantastic.  You can cut your time in half from your normal style time with an ordinary round brush.  It's light and easily scoops up the hair without becoming tangled.  The best part is that it is fairly easy to continue spinning the brush through the hair while you apply heat.  The result is great style - the hair is like a half moon shape silhouette (if you have shoulder length hair) and it looks neatly shaped and has no dents from too small a brush or a curling iron with too small a barrel.  I'll be keeping stocked up on this item!

R1172CPPU8MX0T,"Yes, this!","Better Shea Butter is my new 'go-to&#34; for small order purchases. This cocoa butter came plastic wrapped inside a resealable pouch and was exactly 16 ounces. It's firm, has a nice chocolatey aroma but not too over bearing (7 out of 10) . It's versitile and easy to work with, but being the nature of cocoa butter that has not been deodorized, the chocolate aroma can only be toned down but never muted. Check it out!"

R3M6XI6G7UZFIR,GIVES ME CURL!,I have thick hair on the coarse side which has always been resistant to holding a curl or wave and does just what it wants to do.  My hair is pretty straight but with this product I HAVE CURL AND WAVE for the first time in my life!  I hardly have to do anything to it now and I love it.  The smell is practically nonexistent and should not be of concern.  I have hair just past the shoulders and use 2 pumps in damp hair.  No oily feeling or look at all and it absorbs quickly.  Also allows the hair to dry quicker for some reason.
R7FOFC5BFHWZI,seems to get rid of big red pimples but makes mild acne worse,"I recently discovered that the formula for nanocleanse has changed to glycolic acid instead of salicylic acid.  I was upset when i recieved a different formula than shown on the nanocleanse website.  I have been assured it is good to use, i have only used this product a couple of times, but so far so good, it makes my skin feel nice. Edit one week after i started to use Nanocleanse. I have now developed a few more pimples and the old ones have not gone.  The Nanocleanse people say i should stick with it for another week or two.  I guess i am stuck, i may as well try one more week, but i am a little fed up with how lousy customer service seems to be and the product changing and no one knowing, and now this.  I really wish i had the &#34;old&#34; formula, it seems to have gotten better reviews. Edit after 2 weeks of use.  I have noticed some change, i don't really know if it is agood sign or bad.  A few of the small bumps on my forehead have gotten significantly bigger and redder than they were last week.  Some of the smaller bumps have gotten even smaller though.  I have started using BP on my forehead just at night to get these big ones under control. Edit after 1 month of use.  I stopped using the benzoyl peroxide on my forehead, as it cleared up my spots nicely.  I have been using nanocleanse by itself 2x a day for about a week now.  My skin is starting to break out again in those little bumps.  Seems to me that the exfoliating properties of Nanocleanse irritates my skin.  From research, i have discovered that over exfoliating is bad for the skin, so i am going to use cetaphil alone to wash as well as  the BP again at night, and the Nanocleanse only once or twice a week.  It seems to me, from reading ALL the reviews and my research and experiences, that nanocleanse works OK on the big red angry acne, but causes problems when dealing with more mild cases.  Very disappointed, took a long time to work and caused more breakouts. I doubt i will re order(With the pricebeing high, esp. with international shipping)."
R3NO0F5Z1T1Z3U,"Skeptical at first, great experience!","I received my Crest 3d white brilliance through bzzagent for free. When I got it it was skeptical because I have tried whitening products in the past that either did not work or took a long time to see the effects, or made my teeth really sensitive. After trying this I noticed after the first couple of times that I could see a slight difference. I am very impressed. Also, when I drink hot or cold liquids after doing it I don't notice any pain or sensitivity issues. Love that!! Will definitely purchase and use again!!"
R1TXQ0M82NQLMV,"NYX Glam Shadow Sticks - Set of (5) - Each color has shimmer / sparkle, easy to blend out and are true to their color!","Each color in the set of (5) NYX Glam Shadow Sticks are absolutely beautiful! I have very sensitive eyes and I had no irritation when wearing any of the colors.<br /><br />The color can be applied by using the shadow stick directly to the eyelid and drawing it on, then using a brush to blend or fade. Another way to apply the color is by rubbing a makeup brush ( I use an eye shadow brush ) onto the stick and then gently patting in the color on the lid. Each way works well and gives a unique look.<br /><br />These colors are BOLD, seen easily and all of them have a sparkle shimmer to them - great for an evening look and perfect to wear out to dinner. When the light catches the sparkle in the shadow stick colors they look very pretty and are eye catching. Wearing these colors out throughout the week I was complimented frequently.<br /><br />Each color is easy to blend out once applied. I did have to place a powder over the lids to set the color, I usually do this anyhow - no big deal in my opinion. The lightest color is yellow diamond and I would say the most vibrant and dark would be either Glistening Emerald or Vibrant Amethyst. I will be adding pictures of each color in the direct light and normally to compare the two and show the shimmer sparkles. Discounted sample provided for evaluation and review."

There's many benefits to using tea tree, this shampoo will leave your hair smooth and shiny. I love how it smells I know some hate it but I love it. I also love the fresh feeling on my scalp. The conditioner leaves my hair so smooth and untangles it.  Tea tree oil helps cleans and remove impurities I'm so happy this shampoo contains tea tree. My hair feels and looks so much better. I will continue to use this shampoo and conditioner.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion."

R3BETRNK2OVH3S,I didn't like it!,You are suppose to keep this product in your mouth between your teeth swishing for a minute. I didn't like the burning feeling and doing that for a minute was too long. Then you can't eat or drink for 30 minutes but the burning feeling lasted for some time and it leaves an unpleasant taste. I don't know if it does all the things it claims it does because I didn't do it for more than a few days and saw no change during that time.<br />This is my personal review  as part of the Shopper Army!
R3VQ9U1ZA4K7C2,Love it,I use Amir after my shower to moisturize and give my skin a  slight bit of color.  It has a pleasant mild fragrance. I highly recommend it.

R2E0DADTSH88EU,Good until it broke,"It was good while it lasted. The UV Brush Head Sanitizer stopped working after probably a year, and the toothbrush stopped working at 2 years and 4 months (warranty is 2 years). The toothbrush is good enough that I'll be buying another Sonicare, just not this model since it's older and I had one bust on me. Regarding the different modes, and whether or not this is better than the base model, I honestly only ever used the &#34;Clean&#34; setting, and I don't think many other users would stray too far from that setting either."

RLWKJJD65VYFZ,Just awful.,"This shampoo is just awful. It takes 3 times as much to clean my hair - a handful isn't enough. It does not leave my hair soft or shiny, and to top it off, the scent is terrible. It smells like dog flea shampoo."

RU7U81TT729X3,Not for me..but may be for you,"This made me sooooooooooooooooooo sick! Could be that it was working beautifully but<br />after doing it three times thinking it would get better, it didn't and I just couldn't do it anymore.<br />I was so dizzy each time for hours- I do have some mercury fillings left. I had some removed<br />but had to stop that too because the teeth/molars I had done was sensitive for one whole year.<br />Eating was torture.  So, anyways, I am unsure what it was that made me so dang sick. I kept<br />this in my mouth for 15 minutes. The taste is not too bad at first but after it making me sick<br />by the third time my stomach turned just smelling it.  At least I tried."

R1UPJ9OVI71P93,Preliminary Results: Fuller Brows and Lashes,"I hesitated buying this product because many of the positive reviews are FAKE. If you check, it's the same pattern over and over. They review Viviscal, and on the same day a few other products--I suppose to make it seem like they are real customers.  But that's it--no other reviews from any other day.  Sure, so believeable! And I have a bridge to sell you...<br /><br />Now on to my experience! Earlier in the year I had to go on blood pressure medication that made my hair fall out. It was gradual at first, but began to pick up speed. Changed to a different kind, and with days my hair was falling out by the handfuls. I was beyond upset! Switched to a third medicine and the fallout stopped, but by then the damage was done. I had had incredibly thick hair, and it was soooo much thinner. I realize no one could tell, but it was still upsetting. Quite by accident, I was on a forum (not related to hair) and someone mentioned their hair improved by taking Viviscal.<br /><br />After about a month, it seemed like my eyelashes and eyebrows were a bit fuller, but wasn't sure if it was my imagination/wishful thinking.  (These had thinned over time due to normal aging.)  Now, after two months, they are definitely getting more lush! I am thrilled!!<br /><br />As for hair growth, I definitely can see the new hairs growing in at my temples.  Can't really say if that's due to the vitamins, or just normal hair growth from stopping the bad medicine.  Will try to update this review over time!<br /><br />One other thing to add:  I see others have mentioned getting acne while on this. I am VERY acne prone and have not had this happen."

R366QE8RP9QBV8,A Good Kit for the Whole Family,"This is a great package of essential items you need to keep your face looking young, refreshed and spot free. I enjoyed using some of these items on my face and seeing a difference it made.  I haven't had to use the hair loss treatment however I did like the Adroit which is a hair growth inhibitor.  I also needed to use the Anti Wrinkle Cream as well I'm getting older and I need the help to keep from getting wrinkled.  All in all it is a good kit.  It has a variety of items for the whole family really.  It has Acne cream for the teen or I may use that from time to time I get Acne still.<br /><br />I got this product for free or a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

R1HRZ26XPQ6N6D,Stinky feet be gone!,"I have been using this product now for a week. I am a nursing mother and the prescriptions my dermatologist suggested for my scalp and also the yeast on my chest are both NOT safe for nursing mothers and two, I really honestly don't like taking prescription medicine. My scalp feels so much better already and I am pleased with my results so far with my yeast on my chest. So glad that there is something else out there that I can use while I am nursing. The doctor didn't really tell me of ANY other options and wow... this is perfect! I love the refreshing scent of tea tree oil. Whenever I find a good new product I love to find all the different ways to apply a product to my life. My favorite thing I have used it for is adding it to hot water and soaking my feet in it. After being on my feet all day long it is so nice and relaxing. My husband smelled the aroma it gave off and said he needed to try to haha. He loved it and says he should start doing that regularly! I wouldn't mind because it says it helps deodorize and refresh! Yay! Stinky feet be gone! A requirement for me is a product being vegan and lucky for me... this product is vegan and cruelty free! Oh and I almost forgot to mention that this product is made in the United States which I LOVE. Whenever I applied this wash to my scalp during my shower the other night for the first time I was in awe. I use tea tree oil shampoo and conditioner and if you are not familiar with it... you feel this refreshing tingle. This product provides the same. It is an amazing product and I can't wait to soak my feet in this again tonight!<br /><br />I received a deep discount on this product to provide my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion."

If you buy this product, I'd definitely recommend playing around with it before using it on a big night because I found that the best formula for concealing involves mixing colors! I also like that this has a creamy consistency. I use the warmth of my fingers to get the product and dab it on my face. Its a fun palette and worth the money I paid! I feel bad for the other reviewers who had messed up ones but mine arrived perfectly in the mail."
R2AWN4FD6NP8L1,A little heavy,"Feels heavy on my skin, definitely a nighttime product for me. Mine came with a little spoon that scoops out the right amount to use, which isn't a whole lot, and it goes on very smoothly.

I'll continue to use it - it does seem to soften my skin - but will probably not repurchase."

Regularly one good application will do it from morning tell bedtime, but when the weather goes to an extreme you might need to apply it twice a day. Also if your house is not properly air conditioned, it will turn slightly runny because all of it's ingredients are natural and this is how it's supposed to act under these condetions. Otherwise, I'm fine with it; I already finished 6 pack and I will order 6 more."

After looking at the page I decided to go ahead and purchase because it was a good deal, not expecting much. However I was highly surprised when this item arrived.<br /><br />I really love how the bristles on this brush are short, making the brush fairly dense but really soft at the same time. I was able to wash and sanitize this brush with no shedding so that's a plus and hopefully the brush continues to have no shedding. I have since used this brush to apply liquid foundation and I was really impressed with the results. I typically use brushes by beauty junkees and sigma and I find this brush highly comparable to each of those brands. I will repurchase from this brand in the future.<br /><br />I did purchase this item with a discounted promo code that was advertised on my facebook feed and I am in no way obligated to review this item."

R3S17YHY5FS9G0,If you have fair skin that burns easy this is a must,If you have fair skin that burns easy this is a must! I spray it on after every afternoon I spend in the sun. I have not had it miraculously cure a sunburn overnight but it does sooth it and makes my skin feel more hydrated. This is my third bottle and anyone who uses it usually buys it. By the way... smells amazing!
R1GGIURME1712K,Five Stars,I'm hooked on this one
RBG0A98O2BNAJ,Missing pumps,"I bought this particular set because it came with pumps. However, it was delivered without pumps. Now I have to find and buy pumps somewhere for these bottles. Frustrating. The Living Proof line of hair products is one of my favorites however."

R2B31AONTEQ9YR,Hair loss treatment that works,I have been using Lipogain for Men for 2 years and it corrected my hair loss within the first month and has maintained and improved my hair since.  It is also a great alternative to hair gel or hair cream to style your hair and keep it in place all day while growing new hair.  I have been very happy with this product and will continue to use it.
R38N04DPL13PXB,Love this set,I really love this set.  The lip gloss and eyeshadow and eyeshadow pencil are all basically full size and the travel size of the cheek stick is still decent.  The eyeshadow pencil is my favorite.  It is such a beautiful color and goes well with any eyeshadow combination.  Overall this set is amazing and especially for the price it is a must buy.
R258UHWIX47QF6,Bootleg Suavecito!,"Don't buy this knockoff crap. Buy Suavacito Pomeade, the real product for the same price. They started out as a small business out of Santa Ana, CA. Support them."

R12UQBUKPMY49B,Five Stars,Smells good hadn't tried
R1PJ0LXARRDP66,The price is right and Amazon has great shipping.,"Have used this before in the past. Not sure if it really acts at balancing the hormones. Does have a pleasant smell and it is really makes your skin softer. Just started using now for a couple of weeks, so maybe I need to give the yam cream time to work on the balancing part. There are other yam creams that have a trans dermal effect on the skin and goes directly into the blood stream which seems to me would work faster on the balancing the hormones. Give this a try and just see how it works for you. The price is right and Amazon has great shipping."
R22O502NL0BQNI,Five Stars,Love this
R3LP48XEKVG7ZX,Five Stars,"Love this whole system.  I'm 60 years old, and really like how easy the system is and the results."
R1MENIPBSQ7018,Love,this stuff is amazing! especially if you want to bring your weaves back to life. I left this on for a hr and sat under the dryer before washing it out. It left my hair feeling so soft i was amazed. My friend recommended this product to me and I'm a very happy customer. It also has a nice smell but the smell can be a little over powering at least for me it was. But its not a stink smell at all just a nice but STRONG smell. I would definitely purchase this again.
RMJYI4OK8WUEL,but my skin looks & feels great! It does have a bit of an odd ...,"Been using for about a month now - - don't really see a difference in my brown spots, but my skin looks & feels great!  It does have a bit of an odd smell, but I can put up with it for compliements on my skin!"

R1VF0CSPRMQPO0,Essential essentials,Great product and it arrived quickly. They also sent a free e-book that I can down load to learn more about it's many uses. I am impressed with WellnessScent. They go the extra mile for their customers
R2CX8X03H4RR72,I love this shampoo,"I love this shampoo.  I have dry, curly hair and this takes out a lot of the frizz (I will never have completely frizz-free hair!!).  It also smells heavenly.  I highly recommend it."
RBCHJ0M2V4E17,Love it!,I love this stuff. I originally bought it to help combat beard frizz. It's my primary hair product now.

R3CVOGPNRKOEE4,"All natural, accidentally vegan, and all greatness!","This stuff is amaz-az-ing! Hold Strong ALL DAY and when you wash it out at the end of the day, it leaves your hair soft and bouncy. Smells great (if you like a &#34;piney&#34; smell) and it fits the needs of a vegan! (psst... that's me)"
R2KHIM8LKLO25Q,yes yes y'all,"I might try the darker one soon, but this is pretty great. It helps even out the color disparity between my arms and legs that comes from my usual outfit of jeans and tank tops."
R171PN63IVXI6S,"Nice wig, very durable","I am relatively new to the whole &#34;wig thing,&#34; but this wig has been AWESOME ever since I've owned it...I don't wear wigs every day, but this is the ONLY wig I have owned that hasn't gotten really tangled and has fully maintained its luster after several weeks.  So I would give it an 100% recommendation..."
R22TAPW0VVEKTN,Powerful Toothbrush,"Three strength settings: Low, medium and high. There are also settings for cleaning and whitening. This is a light toothbrush, but powerful. It does a very good job cleaning.  Teeth were whiter in five days as advertised. It stays charged for two days of use."
RYDE5ZPD4GIJW,Quick and effective nail smoothing & buffing device!,"[[VIDEOID:f050fe098e86ea3a136ab5137d36a354]] Wow, this is so much faster than buffing nails with a handheld buffing square like I normally do!  I have ridges in my nails and this flattened them out quickly without heating up my nail bed or being otherwise uncomfortable.  Over smooth, I went over each nail to buff it and they were far shinier and smoother than when I do it by hand.  While it was not the recommended use, I did use the device to file my nails down a tiny bit and it worked very well without causing my nails to splinter or break.<br /><br />It is not incredibly noisy and I was able to do my nails while watching television without increasing the volume too much.  The video shows the unit turned on to show the amount of volume it puts out.<br /><br />The only downside is that it requires two AA batteries, but I used it a few times and the batteries are still going strong so hopefully it does not often need replacements.  I would prefer a rechargeable file, but at least it does not go through batteries quickly.<br /><br />I really love this file and can see it getting a lot of use in the coming years.<br /><br />I received this file at a discount in exchange for my honest review."

R1PFC1FEUKCGZI,Five Stars,I love the cinnamon scent. This product helps stimulate hair growth.
RVNDTIKPISPA0,OMGAWD,I didn't buy this product from Amazon I bought it from target BUT either way I absolutely love this stuff.

R1XYPZ3L0GTQCU,Wonderful scent!,"I've become rather obsessed with the Mrs. Meyers products, and so I tried the Apple hand soap to put at my kitchen sink. It did not disappoint! It smells just as they describe it, with a little &#34;tartness&#34; to it, if you can believe that. I may end up switching to the foam soap to make it last longer, but we'll see."

R7GU2FF5L2A14,Teeth became too sensitive,"I got to try this for free as a promotional product from Crest and BzzAgent. I would have to say I am not a fan of how sensitive it made my teeth feel. Even breathing in caused my teeth to hurt.  I had to stop using after about 2 weeks of use. I would say that it did seem to start whitening, but I just couldn't handle it anymore."
R13NP723Z94Y6B,Another one bites the dust. This hair is Not good quality at all.,"I received this hair from the sender &#34;Dave Carpenter&#34;. This hair is not 100% Brazilian hair it’s more like cheap pack hair from the beauty supply that has a &#34;brazilian feel&#34;. I'm giving it 1 star because it’s actually 100% human hair not a blend. The hair is not soft and is very dry and the wave pattern is terrible. It’s pretty coarse and the ends are ridiculously thin. The hair was shedding as I was pulling it out the package. I ran my hand thru each bundle 3 times and got so much shedding each time. I'm used to getting 3 bundles (300g) so I know what the weight should feel like. The minute I took it out the bag it came in I knew this was not 300g at all. Each bundle seems to be about 60-70g. To make sure I am giving an honest review I put these bundles next to some bundles I already had (fresh out the package), both the same length and both claiming to Virgin Brazilian hair (Last 2 pics). The bundles on the LEFT with the BLACK BAND are bundles I already had from another hair company and the bundles on the RIGHT with the 2 GOLD TWIST TIES are the hair form this order. As you see the bundles on the left are full and the hair is soft and silky its feels great and looks great. Its acatually virgin Brazilian hair as it claimed and the body is full. NOWWWWW The bundles on the right (Elizawigs &#34;brazilian&#34; hair) is thin at the ends and its nowhere near as silky as the hair on the left. I will not bother co washing or conditioning this hair I am actually sending this hair back today for a full refund. I will not be ordering this hair again. I reviewed Dave Carpenters reviews and they are hit or miss that should have been my first sign. As a stylist I try to find affordable quality hair for my clients. I would not recommend this to anyone. You can actually get better quality with pack hair at your local beauty supply. Please do not buy this hair although its cheap and amazon you can get a refund it’s still a hassle not worth going thru. I like to give honest and full reviews with pics so you can see MY experience thoroughly before wasting your time.e honest and full reviews with pics so you can see MY experience thoroughly before wasting your time."
R3AEXFCTE3WP0L,My new Strobing brush!,I actually haven't used this brush yet because I'm eating on some highlighter to come in. I bought this brush to use for strobing. I love the weight of this brush and the dense brush head. It looks and feels like the more expensive brushes. I have bought $40 brushes and this one is just as nice. Can't wait to actually use it!!
R2LLN4FJEY9113,Wonderful all over moisturizer,I love this oil!  It's very lightweight and absorbs quickly.  I use it with essential oils as well as by itself.  It makes a wonderful face moisturizer and doesn't leave my skin oily. A little goes a long way!  I definitely recommend this product.
R2EJQ5L9AUWBGO,Works quick but heavy,Works well but very heavy to hold.  I had my old dryer for at least 15 years and it was light so I was not used to holding such a heavy dryer.
R3J2MO7AEGN7MF,Great product but jus doesn't work for my hair,I purchased because of such great reviews but it must be my hair because it's not left feeling soft once it dries. I am African American with natural curly hair that stays dry. I thought I'd give this a try. Sigh... back to the drawing board!!!

So after some research I bought this waterpik. I love the way my teeth feel after I use the water flosser, I have tried almost all the attachments. Can't wait to see what the hygienist says at my next appointment. I do recommend this for maintaining healthy gums."

R8G0KURPFFG3K,Battery dies after 6 months,Battery died within 6months. Now it won't hold a charge and can only be used for a few minutes at a time. Apparently this is a common issue. I upgraded to the Emjoi Emagine epilator and love it.
R8TXXZBCBVDP2,I really like this brand of Acne treatment,"I really like this brand of Acne treatment. I didn't mind the pills but prefer the Nature's Cure facial wash. I can never remember to take the little pills. The facial wash works just as good, if not better. Either way, this is a brand with great products."
R1X2OBHSON98IP,Good Basic Shampoo,This is a good basic shampoo. It is distinctively minty but not overpowering. Lathers up well and rinses clean.
R1CR79CRZP9AOG,Five Stars,"I would buy this product again, and again."
RUWKXWG0NOUTO,Great buy.,"I use this palatte to countour, remove under eye bags, and even out redness.  The green is applied over red areas, and then I smooth it out with a damp makeup sponge.  The yellow is used under my dark eye circles and is amazing. When you put the yellow on go beyond the dark eye circles with it and blend it in well.  Tired mom eyes will disappear.  I use the lighter shades to further contour my cheek bones, nose, mouth and chin.  I have not used the darker colors, I use a different product for the dark part of contouring."
R2FJ4P542HLP9D,Very Impressed.,"I Just want to start out with that I also use this product with Body Merry Cellulite Defense cream. So keep that in mind. I'm pretty athletic, and have a good amount of muscle, but lets face it. I'm also female and have those lovely trouble spots. With this, I feel like I've actually seen a difference and a better feel to my skin.<br /><br />It's great to use in the shower, and massage out some sore muscles. Also, I've seen a better clarity in my skin, not so many bumps and things on the surface. That's a good start. It's also made with good quality, and creates a good lather. Easy to clean, rinse off, and dry. I would definitely recommend this to someone else. In fact, gonna spread the love to my family."
R3B0TF1IG4PPZK,"Great Tooth brush...(Simply the Best, Tina Turner?)",This is the best tooth brush! I bought one of these lost it in flight and quickly replaced it...Simply the best that my meager income can manage...Performs way...Over the Top! God Bless Y'all!

The shampoo worked pretty well first use and I believe will perform better with continued use. Due to allergies, she needed a product that would work with as little botanical ingredients as possible.Thank you Amazon for carrying this product!"

R2YEIIDM2224I7,Five Stars,great product!!  Love it!
R2ASZFEL1GUXPF,"Only good for highly ""jelled up"" looks... not good as a dry shampoo to remove oils","I didn't find this to do ANYTHING in the &#34;clean your hair&#34; department. It's supposed to be a dry shampoo and it didn't make my hair look any cleaner at all.  Since my hair gets greasy within a day or two of washing, it basically is useless for me.  It would be better for my son; who can go a few days without washing his hair; and if he was in a rush could use it; but it really is just adding &#34;product&#34; to your hair and makes it look that way.<br /><br />Smell is fine, albeit a bit strong like most Axe products."
R2ZR0P0LZNJGLN,pretty good,It seems fine don't know yet if its a added plus but it does feel good going on and goes into skin very well
R1ZDXKX1FCJTEG,Worth the money,"Very nicely designed- finish looks very durable, seems like it will last quite awhile.  Its bigger than the cake soap I use, but really doesn't affect anything.  Well pleased with it."

R2UV3K59B3E5IL,Four Stars,Great product.
R5KQTOKOTK1LK,Yes !,"[I received a discount on this item in return for my unbiased honest opinion] I already use the hyaluronic acid and vit c serum [in different bottles] from this manufacturer. When I saw this product [vit c, Hyaluronic acid AND vit e] I thought that would be a great triple threat addition to my home made facial oils. I was right. The hyaluronic acid really ups the moisture retention of my oil, and the vit c and vit e make it a powerhouse anti aging combo. Neutral color, neutral scent, nice dark bottle to protect the ingredients, ideal for home use."

R2MNLJLMZ5X4FE,Four Stars,The smell is strong.
R2UFOFDIEBN1TE,One of my favorite cosmetic products.,"Absolutely amazing. Must be, if the French are using it and their skin is immaculate I thought I should give it a try. After reading other reviews I stumbled over the one that warned to not use it when you have acne, cystic acne during peri-menopause adds insult to injury, and so I tried it on my super dry skin. What can I tell you, Lupine Protein first and a good body lotion after (my preferred product for dry skin is Biotherm Lait Corporel) and I felt good in my body again. After two bottle of the Lupine Protein I must say, surprised and widely smiling, that it seems to have a firming effect on my skin. Imagine that! Nothing can make cellulite disappear or turn back the clock, but my skin is clearly firmer now. I only wished this product came in a larger size. Still, delivery time is super fast, often even beating Amazon Prime."
R1W541TJATFB3B,Excellent product,"Excellent product, I have severe acne and this has helped clear it up.  Even after washing my face this gets so much more out of my pores and it doesn't dry your face."

RRLN8TQAT2H48,Dye didn't stick,"I did a lot of research before picking a brand. Maybe it was just my hair or my specific bottle of dye... but all of the dye washed out within a week. Like, ALL of the dye. It just didn't stick. Maybe I did something wrong, maybe my hair was just not okay with it. But I'm sorry that it happened. I think pravana is great and looks great, but I can't deny that it didn't work for me."
R2I7UVKSIOJU3A,Five Stars,A great product.
R1FIQAKUHFDP79,GREAT EYE SHADOW!!!,I absolutely LOVE this eyeshadow... it goes on very smooth and looks great.. I will be purchasing this again. I like Urban Decay and this is a great substitute.
R2Z9U3KC0DR8E1,excellent natural moisture,"Fantastic product and packaging from Pura d'or. I have been using argan oil for about 6 months as a facial moisturizer and can't say enough good things about it. I was very skeptical at first and not sure how my rather sensitive skin would react to being &#34;oiled up&#34;, but now I can say I'm truly impressed and will be usng it as long as I can get my hands on it. It feels great and soaks into the skin nicely- never feels greasy. I love that it's 100% pure, renewable, organic and all natural giving me peace of mind that there will be no negative side effects to using it for many years. A 4oz. bottle lasts many months even using it twice a day because a little goes a long way. Convenient pump-top bottle is perfect for easy use. Very fair price as well because it lasts so long."

R40IAL5D338KQ,I would recommend it for light activities,The lotion is really smooth and is lightweight. There isn't a distinct scent and lasts for a really long time. I did not get sunburnt after 5 hours of wearing this sunscreen. I would recommend it for light activities.

RS4UQD1LXC21U,Amazing!,Love this product!
R31D0GZV2BHBG2,Expensive but helpful,I can imagine this routine can get expensive & plenty of people will be reading reviews in an attempt to help them decide if it's worth it. With this in mind & really bc of this reason I wrote this review although my knowledge is very limited.<br />I purchased this as a gift for a male 17 year old with reaccurring acne issues. He'd tried everything available to him over the counter & had very limited success. I purchased this as a birthday gift being it was too expensive for him to buy but he &#34;needed it&#34;. Turned out he really did &#34;need it&#34; bc it worked wonderfully on his skin. By the time he finished the product it cleared him up & he's saving for his replacement. So I guess it was worth the money.
RM4X9SPK0ILTY,Great price,Came promply. It went well for what I needed it for and is a gret price for it.
R27SWV8SR1MFQJ,Five Stars,Love it!
R2MCBVX7KD9JIH,Works Great - Priced Right!,"The texturizing spray has a pleasant smell that is not overpowering.  It does not take a lot of the spray to get results.  Applied to wet hair and then blow-dried it provides good body and lift to the hair.  It does not leave the hair sticky, and makes the hair easy to style. This is a product that I would purchase and use on a regular basis.  The current price is right also!  Suave offers “Sea Mineral Infusion” to a variety of their hair and body products."
R172VXKHUPCQ65,"A low charge light would be great, but this dows the job","Good, recharge lasts at least a week, using it everyday for under 10 minutes, smooth with super close head, the old 4000 was only lasting about 4-5 days then it was slowing down...good buy, good delivery, good price, wish it had a charge light and when it was fully charged."
R2ZTSE3NY8F2XL,Leaves hair with excellent texture,Product was well wrapped and arrived on time. I used it and have been very satisfied with the texture of my hair following use.

R1TIS8IEHEVKI5,My daughter has one and hers works so much better than mine and that was what I expected in ...,"I have often wondered if this was an authentic Corioliss. My daughter has one and hers works so much better than mine and that was what I expected in this one. I loved the zebra color, however, as of the first use the stripes started to fade off. I'm not complete satisfied with it but its better than the one I replaced."
R1H699OJKM0V93,Five Stars,Everything was shipped on time and the product came in as posted

RGZEHN82MATHR,Great gift,Great gift for any young lady that likes to paint her nails.  Keeps all your polishes together so you know colors you have.
R4Q9EHHCEQDJS,A little on the boring-why-bother side,I thought the colors would be much more vivid. Most of the colors are just 'muddy' looking on me. A couple were okay making it worth the price.
R138OXTTKN60GA,Five Stars,It arrived quickly and seems to do the job well.
R2MOUW2ATOBU7P,My acne has since gotten much better but I remain on a retinol for its anti-aging ...,"I have literally been on a retinol for 30 years!! I remember back when :) I was put on retin-A for acne and remained on that prescription for many, many years which has really helped my acne, particularly when I experienced cystic acne. My acne has since gotten much better but I remain on a retinol for its anti-aging benefits. I find this product to be very good. There are different levels so if you have not used a retinol you may want to step down and use the .25 or .50 and work your way up. I find I have very little redness or irritation with this, which can be a problem for retinoids in general. There are lots of retinol products on the market anymore but I think for the price point and quality of this particular one you simply can't beat it.<br /><br /> I am 46 years old and people tell me everyday that I don't have a single wrinkle on my face. I attribute that to long term retinol use."
R3RIW7VURKD8DQ,High quality shears!,"I have been cutting hair for years; & took a chance on these shears.  I use them at work and they cut through the hair lie butter!  Nice fit on my hands.  Also they look so chic!  If you are a professional&#60; I highly recommend!  If not; these are way too sharp for at home use, in my opinion."
R1OP4L53QK2CHI,Not like the GEM PTFE blades at all,Very rough and tuggy blades. Not like the GEM PTFE blades at all.
R3PD7QMGH5NE97,Five Stars,Great

R1BLOYHUFW7LLO,Four identical watches?,"I was disappointed, the sight displayed four identical watches, when they arrived after taking forever, three were identical and one was totally different. It was much smaller. It was a disappointment. I did not receive what i paid for."
R3D95KY76C6SEP,These are nothing like the original,"These are nothing like the original, more like cheap knockoffs that do not do the job. These were not sturdy or well made, like the original. The plastic cover that goes over the rotating pieces does not stay on nor does the battery compartment cover once the batteries are in place. Worst of all, the units would not remove hair at the root (like they are supposed to) and actually burned/cut my face, leaving abrasions all over my face."
R3DPKXRAIRMXO6,Good.,Good but a little stiff.
RQJ5FQ3GINBLB,best waterproof eye makeup remover ever,Perfect works great even for lash stain.
R1MM58S2X8DJNI,So happy to find these metal nail files,"So happy to find these metal nail files. Lost several at airports some time ago, and have never been able to find in stores since. I find the newest type of files for sale dull and unsatisfactory.  These are great!"

R32JX1YBB5U6EK,Four Stars,Good.
R2CIZG0D4O3QF8,Love it,So light and got this spicy blend to it. I wear it at night mostly.
RWSK563HTPMO5,Great toothbrushes!,These are great toothbrushes.  Really clean well and keeps my teeth white without chemicals.
R2GQ92TALR2PQP,Couldn't be more happy!,"After moving from Hawaii to Georgia I think a mixture of stress and serious changes in water cause me to develop scalp psoriasis for the first time ever. I tried tea tree oil, medicated shampoo and sprays and other at home remedies before a hair stylist recommended finding a tar based shampoo. Within the first week of using it the itchy feeling lessened tremendously. About a month in now and I am almost completely flake free. It recommends using it twice a week but I'll admit I use it everyday, and will continue till 100% clear, then I'll probably go down to twice a week. This shampoo does smell like coal!!!! But I am okay with it as long as I'm not wearing nasty flakes.<br /><br />Also, I added 5 drops of tea tree oil to mine to help with smell and irritation."
R3B0VIUAG3MDHK,Excellent product,Covers the growing out gray perfectly. Went out with some friends and mentioned that I was going to the salon the next day for color and cut and they all were surprised as they did not see any roots!
R1VI02YDHBR984,Perfect!,"while the picture comes out lighter then the actual colors, it's a phenomenal color payoff! I bought the color in rosey and its a great light pink! It doesn't make you look like a clown, which I love. I am also fair skinned (Porcelain is a better way to put it) and I'm hesitant with blushes, being so fair skinned. I'm happy to say i can compare it to my NARS super orgasm blush. It's a close enough dupe to the NARS in my opinion :)"
R3VR9NMMT9QP1G,Five Stars,Great value!
RGMISV8XTYCGF,I started using it and hoping for the best!,"It arrived today on time but I think it was over packed in a huge box. I started using it and hoping for the best! Well I'm still using it and like its texture and how it feels on the skin but I still didn't see much result, however I'm thinking of buying somewhere to see a better result by continuing."
R3REJV7WUTZN9Q,Five Stars,This is great.
RU9MK5VWMBZQ4,I recently bought Kat Von D's Tattooed Concealer and I was majorly disappointed. I threw it away after the second use,"I am a makeup junkie. So as for concealers, I have tried PLENTY! I recently bought Kat Von D's Tattooed Concealer and I was majorly disappointed. I threw it away after the second use, to be honest. Needless to say, I was in a rush to find a concealer that would actually work without becoming cakey and creasy. I had heard great things about this concealer, so I jumped at the opportunity to try this product, AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! Went out shopping all day, then drinks with my hubby and 12 hours later, no creases and no cakey look. This will be my holy grail of concealers from now on, Thank you, Tarte!!!!!!<br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion and review."
R3IBDS65VOH7I9,All so this is not a very good oil smell is very weak,My firsrt order came leaked all over my box sent back 2nd order came it was leaking all over too. Did not send back why bother. They need to look at the way they send there oils. All so this is not a very good oil smell is very weak . And mixed with a carrier oil. Thought I would give it a try but will go back to my to other brands I have bought in the pass that are MUCH better.
R3B8YDTC50MO3P,45 dollars wasted,I'm black and I thought this would be perfect but it's not dark enough. The stencils are kinda neet but need to get use to using them.
R3CHWTT63CRIVP,Very good product and prompt service delivery,Enough to make batches of skin treatment.  Very good product and prompt service delivery.
R1FEFVGKWWWX6P,Great & not shedding,These are great brushes for the value. I use them everyday & they are not shedding!
R2A6SSKQIRI5AB,... a number of years and I can't say enough good things about it,"I have been using this product for a number of years and I can't say enough good things about it. I have tried many lip products and absolutely none of them kept my lips from becoming chapped and cracked. This product works 100% of the time.? I apply it to my lips every night before I go to sleep as well as any day that I am not wearing lipstick. My lips never get chapped, cracked or rough! My constant problem disappeared with this product!"
R3JDO6US5ON1EO,Color not as rich as shown in photo.,"Color is not as rich or saturated as shown in pic. Not a deep cherry, more like a light cherry. Texture is more like a half gloss half lipstick. Feels ok, but I wouldn't purchase this line again."
R3DJ0NM1QD6OBY,Great quality - hardens quickly and lasts long,"I love that this comes as a set of 2, as you obviously need both to do a complete manicure. This was a great value, and works wonderfully. It goes on smooth, and hardens quickly in the UV lamp. Provides a quick at-home manicure"
R3KPZXHTAOT6ET,And i liked your handmade book mark,"Thank you so much for this product, i recieved it today! And i liked your handmade book mark!!! Thanks alot dear,,,,,"
R3UDJZ21D5Z0V1,Great smell...hair retains moisture,Smells great and I've only been using for a week but can feel my hair retaining moisture from use. Good stuff and I'll buy again. I'm in the process of growing out chemically relaxed/texturized hair so finding something with moisture that helps the curls come back is key. I still have to do some scrunching but hair is looking MUCH better.
R20BUM7UN4E3BL,I love this kit,I love this kit! It comes with a lot of useful stuff but I'm not sure how to use half of them lol. The waxing strips are strong and don't tear easily when you pull. The wax is really nice too it's for sensitive skin which is great of you tend to swell a lot like I do. Over all it was a great purchase and I'd fortunately buy another one
R2SMZL5BHP386Y,this one is definitely great. I usually use a powder dove stick,"For a gel deodorant, this one is definitely great. I usually use a powder dove stick.. but the smell of this one is great. I sampled it during a BzzCampain with BzzAgent and really glad I did. I would purchase again, and it definitely last's all day long."

R1SNWV6IOGJ6NL,Four Stars,Very nice i iwll buy it again.
R34K8K2G7V5RE5,"Works as expected, may sting sensitive eyes",The chemical in the product stings my eye a little when applying to lashes. But it when I use it as a base it pumps up the volume of my mascara and helps prevent smudging during the day.
R1B3FU45KV9I59,Great purchase!!,Love this product!
R2RF63X1BXO76Y,Excellent assortment of tools needed to do a good job,"Excellent assortment of tools needed to do a good job. They come packaged well in their own little plastic cases, very colorful. Just a real fine assortment. Recommend these to all!"

R3GFRE0NROASIX,FOUND the PERFECT Facial Sponge,I will use these forever!  They are just PERFECT!  They feel so good on my skin and cleanse beautifully.
R2BDGEJAQQ6D74,Great streighner,"Works very well, I was a little thrown off of the fact the streighner had scratches on it"

RL7P01D3FH0O7,Four Stars,Love the product.  The boxes were crushed when received.
R28ZBRCHU8ZL4S,This serum tightens and tones my skin like no other,I have used this and other clarin products for a number of years.  This serum tightens and tones my skin like no other.  I am never without it.  I would suggest using AM and PM.  Just a small tab will work for the face and neck.
RDP3FESF6NDT0,Its nice for those who need a very light coverage i ...,Its nice for those who need a very light coverage i &#34;recommend&#34; i like it and could buy it again :)
RH2KFGKT1VP5E,Good product easy to use.,"The instructions are  clear and the product is easy to use.  Some things, like a glass receptacle, will not be included, so that will need to be purchased.  Also, I didn't have a mask when I poured the solvent, and I needed one."
RVHT6W6JGHHC2,Iris with a lot of violet,This is a soft sensual iris and violet fragrance built over a lightly sweetened  musk.  Gorgeous stuff.
R1BIV7U9I5R4UA,Five Stars,Love!!
R6ZLJABJC648Z,Glad I found this!,"This is one of the best moisturizers I have found.  My stylist turned me on to it a while back.  I just need to use a little at a time, so it lasts."

R1VFHQ2NUZ6VSD,Five Stars,So beautiful especially for the price! Will look perfect for my wedding day!
R3RPX34YDU1F95,Best spray for hold with limited breakage,GREAT stuff. Love to style my hair high but other sprays make it stiff and break. This spray is by far the best I've ever used and holds the style without all the mess or breakage.
R2HQAB6BX0G0IQ,Bad Delivery,I bought this for my husband and I am not impressed with its performance. It doent deliver a close shave.
R26H9X2K8FD1E1,Love what it did for my feet!,"I have to say I Love it! With that said I received this item in exchange for giving my honest and unbiased opinion. When I received it in the mail I could tell that the wood part was very durable but was skeptical about the file part because ones like that haven't worked for me in the past but this one worked amazingly. My feet get pretty bad and its hard to find a product that can remove all the dry callused skin. This product was easy to use, it works on dry feet and makes them smooth and look like you got your feet professionally done."
R2QJFYO3BHO07S,Really really happy with this.,"I have been using this produce for 4 months now, it has changed my life. No more night sweats, no more loss of sleep, I'm calmer and not always on edge.  Oh of course natural stress occurs, and I am going through menopause so it will happen, but a lot less frequently.  Thank you!"
R6TMCFK3Y1PR2,Four Stars,OK
R122MZGHQWLCO7,Not such a great idea to send it in a little bag/envelope,"Actually when I opened the bag it came in, it was all cracked to pieces and the powder was everywhere.  Not such a great idea to send it in a little bag/envelope...I have no idea what the powder is like unfortunately."
R2W2RUC4JYOFDL,Five Stars,I love them! Thank you!

R3TCCQJQY045UF,Four Stars,Met my expectations
R1S26W94QX6F51,"Made my hair full, but not frizzy!","This shampoo has a pleasant scent and it lathers well.  A little goes a long way-about a quarter sized amount did all of my hair (which is just above my shoulders).  It rinses clean without leaving residue, but still left my hair full, yet smooth.  I used only the shampoo, let me hair air dry, and then use the straightener to style it.  It did keep my hair sleek and fluffy without a bunch of flyaways, but still a nice fullness.  Overall, this works well even alone, which I really like.  And it lasts for about 2-3 days with a good styling."
RYZJH0X8W6MUG,Five Stars,Excelent
R2LP5ULIUJGZ9Z,Five Stars,Fast shipment and item just as described.  Many Thanks😊

R33SSTGLH21AAR,Five Stars,Good stuff
R2VNK9K91KQWY9,Great toothbrush for the price,Works great. Cleans very well especially the back. The price was the deciding factor when looking at the Oral B & Sonicare. Read reviews on both and does just as good a job as the Sonicare. Louder than my old Sonicare but am used to it now.
R3K1ZD2FD77DP6,Five Stars,my favorite lotion and the service for delivery has never failed me !

R78POTJZ20A5W,I've been using these Godefroy Tint Kits for about a ...,"I've been using these Godefroy Tint Kits for about a year.  I have very fair eye-brows, so a light-brown has always worked well.  Unfortunately this time the light-brown turned my brows to almost black and no, I did not leave it on for too long.  Overall, the product is effective in keeping my brows colored for about 10 days, which is by far more convenient than using a pencil; therefore the 4 star rating. I am wondering whether the wrong color was put in this box."
R14FVDUVQXY4H,Five Stars,"Love love love this mascara, came early, works great, will order again."
R1WFSG0864AJ6U,BUY IT!!!!,"Ok, I cannot stress this enough... its the best eyeliner ever! I've paid 20 bucks for a gel waterproof eyeliner and it was a lie.... this eyeliner is absolutely the best...  I sweat and have oily skin and after a 12 hr day I look in the mirror this bad boy is still on!!! Absolutely impressed with how long it stays on.... plus it won't break your bank lol... BUY IT! it's different for everyone but this product is how it worked out for me!"
R1RG2PZ3APMMPH,It actually works!,"It actually works!  I will admit, I put a deodorant to the test.  &#34;Natural&#34; deodorants typically don't work for me. I had used a paste over 10 years ago that actually worked then I could no longer get it in the States. Due to that experience I was excited and hopeful upon hearing about Primal Pit Paste. I have tried the Lavender in the paste form and Orange in the tube form...and one application lasts all day!!!  I am more than pleased with Primal Pit Paste and have recommended it several others!"
R2UCC3ERY9ED9T,Only for older version of clarisonic,These do not fit a clarisonic 2

RXFJTLXBUY98D,Three Stars,Good
R131RY82MHR9UA,Works wonderfully!,"I am finally coming to accept the fact that the face creams and lotions of my youth will no longer cut it when it comes to fighting lines and wrinkles in my 40s. You have to hit them with something stronger, and Beautybliss has what it takes! This cream has made a difference I can see in just a few short days! It absorbs quickly and it doesn't take a lot, so this jar will last a good, long time. My fine lines are lessened and I understand that I should see a difference in even my deeper lines with time. I can't wait to see my results! I feel it is worth mentioning that I am prone to breakouts with many products, but I haven't had so much as a single blemish since I've been using this. I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion, and I'm very pleased with it."
R2M66A1HU01W80,I normally wear expensive mascara but always disappointed with the waterproof formula,I normally wear expensive mascara but always disappointed with the waterproof formula. This waterproof mascara lived up to its name. It stayed all day and even held up through a shower (I didn't rub my eyes). I wore it the ocean and it didn't smear till about four hours in so I thought it was great!
R2Z80WJQGE4SJI,Perfect exfoliating cleanser,"Gets skin really clean in one go, even with makeup on. Doesn't dry out my skin, but controls oil well too. I don't need any moisturizer after, my skin is left with the right amount of moisture. My skin is soft, smooth and a little bit clearer.<br /><br />I appreciate that the beads are biodegradable (jojoba), and not plastic microbeads, like a lot of cleansers have.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that it has a rather strong perfume-y smell. But this doesn't linger after rinsing, so it's not a big deal. Would definitely buy again!"

RWS9KMNS5Q1WV,"Works great, but too painful for my legs - although that's probably just me being a baby.","I have only used this a few times with the large attachment, so I can't speak for any of the other attachments.  It hurts too much so far for me to use it anywhere aside from my arms, but hopefully with more attempts, I will eventually be able to use it for at least my legs, which is really what I purchased it for."

I previously had the rechargeable model until it shorted out after dropping it in water. This model is almost identical; but with the benefit of replaceable batteries - which is usually a hassle/money waster. Instead of having to wait a few hours to get the full speed and avoid snagging, a simple battery swap is all that's needed; which has not yet been the case. The first set of batteries have lasted months, and still do not require changing. While the rechargeable model was perfect for me; if I felt like I ever needed to replace this, I'd definitely buy it again."

R1LHGGT61CWHHY,"Sadly, Minimal Results","Many Asian Beauty users swear by snail bee essence, so don't let my ho-hum review deter you from taking a shot. Just know that it's not a miracle cure for everyone (maybe everyone but me). I used this product daily until I used up the bottle. It lasted for several months, which was a perk. However, I did not observe any noticeable improvement to my skin overall. It has a bit of an odd scent, but alas, it is snail bee essence, so it's to be expected. It soaked in quickly but left my skin feeling a little tight. Not problematic, though, as I followed it up with a hyaluronic serum and moisturizer. Again, it wasn't a holy grail type of product for me, but it is for many people."

RCYXTDFZH39R8,Tastes Great and Freshens Breath,"I have tried many mouthwashes in my past, and Crest Pro-Health is my #1favorite. It leaves my mouth feeling really clean, has a great taste and I love the fact that it's alcohol free. Besides freshening breath, if it really does do all of the other things that are listed on the bottle, then I'm all for it and it will always be my first choice when it comes to mouthwash. You can't beat a product when besides being a mouthwash, it protects you from cavities, strengthens enamel and cleans teeth and gums all at once.<br />[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]"

After an unsuccessful attempt to find any at my local store, I was happy to find this one. It's perfect! It's not sticky or goopy. It lasted for a few hours without eating/drinking. It has a light, pleasant scent that's barely noticeable. So if you're looking for plain, clear lip gloss, this one is for you!"
R1YJWKNES1N2QK,Would not buy again,"This product is pricey, and you need to buy a larger sharpener to go with it.<br />It is not a one step product. Once you apply this, you have to use another brush or spoolie to shape the brows. It also leaves my brows feeling sticky. Sometimes little pieces of lint can stick to my brows.<br /><br />I would much rather stick to the ELF clear brow gel."

RTQBV1BZPIDII,"Fantasy Massage Oil Candle - 10oz, good for romance, light, and a stress free mood - Feels good massaged into the skin!","It never hurts to have a candle around - for light, romance or even for it's calming effect. After a stressful day I love to light some candles and drink a glass or two of wine.<br /><br />The fantasy massage oil candle is unlike most candles I own, however. When I light the candle I let it sit and burn for a while to build up some melted wax in the jar. Once the wax is melted it can be poured onto the skin (it did not hurt me, but I would test before pouring on someone else).<br />This candle has oil in it, so once on the skin it makes for a lovely massage! I can easily rub the wax around, relieving pain and moisturizing my skin. Sample provided for evaluation and review."

R2DC8PR7K94GGI,Just what I needed!,"Let me just start by saying two things: 1) I NEVER write reviews and 2) I've always been skeptical about the effectiveness of &#34;natural&#34; products.  But I'm so ecstatic with this shampoo that I feel it's my civic duty to share it with the world.  I've had mild excema on my scalp for about the last five years.  At first the breakouts were very sporadic and did not go beyond my hairline.  I treated it with a topical steroid lotion prescribed by my doctor with good results.  In the last year or so I noticed that it was flaring up more frequently, and covering more territory on my poor, defensless scalp.  I even got it in my ears....ahh, good times!  Over this past Summer it began spreading.  I was getting red, angry bumps on the back of my neck, just below my hairline - which looked awesome when I wore my hair up (not!).  My prescription steroid did not seem to be working as well as it used to and I was getting desperate.  I turned to the trusty world wide web to find a solution and eventually stumbled on to this shampoo.  After reading a positive review from someone with very similar symptoms, I pulled the trigger and ordered.  I have used this shampoo a grand total of three times and cannot believe the difference in my hair and scalp.  After the first use, the itching was noticeably reduced and the redness and flakiness began to go away.  This was after one use, people!!  I was so excited that I began to research more natural and holistic remedies.  Enter, essential oils.  I bought some lavendar and chamomile essential oils (which are supposed to be good for maintaining a healthy scalp) and added about seven drops to the shampoo to give it a boost.  Wow!! Now I'm really on to something!  I dare say my scalp feels almost clear of any excema and my hair looks more hydrated and healthy.  And I haven't used my steroid lotion since I got this shampoo!<br /><br />I follow the directions exactly (lather, let it sit a few minutes, and repeat). I also bought the Silk 18conditioner by Maple Holistics.  These products are exactly as advertised, which is so refreshing.  I'm now a believer in the power of  natural products."
R3USIWWMMWD36A,"DOES NOT WORK- YES, USED PROPERLY","DOES NOT WORK!  TERRIBLE!  We have given this sunscreen several chances to protect our family- failed each time.  We applied it liberally and thoroughly, then waited 15-20 minutes before sun exposure.  We reapplied it every 45 minutes.  We were ALL sunburned.  Warning: you must use a stronger and more reliable sunscreen than this one if you plan on being in the sun.  Spray nozzle broke the first day, and was never able to be repaired.<br />Bottom line: Product does not protect sun AND Spray nozzle defective."

R3JAHARUI2BG7Z,Holy Grail Acne Product!,"UPDATE: After three months of using the A-sol, I realize just how invaluable this product is with my routine. My main issue is hormonal acne, especially on my chest and back. I did notice the change in my skin when I first started using this product; however, after three months, I've had very little issues with my hormonal acne. I happened to get lazy with my routine, and after a week of not using this product, I started to breakout on my chest and back. At that point, I realized that this is one of my must-use products. I pair it with Stridex in the Red Box, another BHA. Together, these work flawlessly to keep my acne at bay. Thank you, Cosrx!<br /><br />ORIGINAL: I follow an Asian Beauty skincare routine, and I was hoping to have luck with this product as many others have. I've been using it for almost a month with no noticeable change in my skin. I will continue to use it with the hopes of it panning out for me. Skincare is a &quot;your mileage may vary&quot; sort of deal. If you were considering this product, don't let my results deter you. Many have had good success with it. Cosrx makes quality products. This one just wasn't for me."

R2QN7ZT73FP1YZ,Excellent Product & Service,"Fantastic product. I used Max Factor Pan-Stik for years until it was discontinued, then had to start searching for a replacement.  I tried several different makeups, then the light went on that Pan-Stik was originally developed as a stage makeup.  I ordered from this company, and could not be happier with the product or the service.  It was a little hard to judge the color first time I ordered, but got it right the second time and am hoping Mehron is around for a good long time."

R1V66G6VMW5K2G,Good for Pesky Wet Spots,"I was given a FREE trial size to test out as a BzzAgent and I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  I like how the gel keeps me dry and doesn't create any pesky wet spots under my arms.  The fresh scent also lasts and lasts throughout even the hottest and busiest of days.  The one thing I did not like was the sticky feeling that this left.  That's why I can't &#34;love it&#34; and give it 5 stars.  I think this is a great product and worth buying if you have wet spot issues or are very active.  I plan to keep some of this on hand for days when I know I'm going to sweat a bit more, but it won't replace my regular deodorant."

I will say that the blades on these razors are very sharp.  I ended up nicking myself bad shaving but I will continue using this amazing razor.  I stopped using razors all together but after using Bic Soleil Glow razors, I will start again.  This razor does a great job of removing annoying hair without leaving stubble behind. I love that it has three blades, which allows me to shave quicker and get the hair that is sometimes left behind.  Thanks to this wonderful razor, my legs feel incredibly smooth without any stubble bumps and without any razor bumps or rashes.  I used this razor this morning after I decided to wear a dress at the last minute and it took me less time than before to have smooth legs to show while wearing my dress."

RKEEXI87JBD50,I Like Better than My Sonicare + No Charging Works Better for Me,"I have been using a sonicare toothbrush for about the past 18 months or so. Around 6 weeks or maybe 2 months ago, I had my teeth cleaned. At that time, I asked the dental tech if she noticed any difference in the scale on my teeth. She consulted my chart and said &#34;Not too much. You tend to accumulate scale a bit faster than average&#34;.  I was disappointed because I thought the Sonicare would help with that.<br /><br />I like the Sonicare well enough except it's intense and when I brush the backs of my front teeth, I have to hold the bridge of my nose because the vibration will make me want to sneeze and it's not good to sneeze with a mouthful of saliva and toothpaste. Big mess.<br /><br />I probably would have just continued to use my sonicare because it was costly and it does work better than a manual toothbrush but then Vine offered me this set of Spinbrushes. I've used Spinbrushes in the past and LOVED them! I like that they are battery operated so no charging. If I'm away from home and it begins to run down, I just change the batteries. If the sonicare brush quits at home then I have to finish using a manual toothbrush. I never have that happen with the Spinbrushes.<br /><br />I also like that they have both a round head and the rectangular section. I feel like I'm brushing a greater area so in the two minutes I take to brush, I'm covering more &#34;ground&#34; than I do with the Sonicare which has a very small, almost child sized rectangular brush area. Also, the Spinbrushes don't make me want to sneeze and are not so intense as to be uncomfortable.<br /><br />Since my dental hygienist didn't notice a huge difference between the Spinbrush (which was what I used before sonicare) and my sonicare, I'd rather use the Spinbrush.<br /><br />This set includes Arm & Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste (which we really like), two brushes and two extra heads so this will last me probably about 5-6 months before I have to buy more heads and in the past, I've had the Spinbrush base last literally a couple of years. Lots of times I just replaced them because I wanted a different color or they came out with a new style that I wanted to try.<br /><br />If you tend not to accumulate scale at an above average rate like I do, maybe the sonicare would help you better but I prefer the Spinbrush and most likely that's what I'll be using for a long time to come. They are reasonably priced, I can easily find the replacement heads where I live and I like not having to charge them and especially since there is only one lonely plugin in my bathroom and it's always taken up with other appliances.<br /><br />I highly recommend these.nbrush base last literally a couple of years.

R3DAOFLMU24KPI,"Solid, sturdy, and attractive but with mashed-bristles and continuous shedding, I'm not as impressed as I had hoped I would be","Stiff bristled brushes to my liking are so very difficult to find. I put them through their paces and so often the bristles fall out or they get soft and pliable after one or two uses. I can't even recall how many I've gone through this year alone. In need of a new brush in order to groom my gorgeous facial topiary, I didn't know what new brush to try. I saw this one and liked the look and read the reviews, but I'm extremely skeptical by nature and my expectations were not exactly high. I've had very bad luck in the past with beard brushes. However, I realise how very wrong I was to dismiss it even before it arrived. This one is attractive and sturdy. The wood is clean and solid. The bristles arrived semi-mashed and they have been shedding, even after a number of uses. Still, it seems to be holding up better than some others I have used. It arrived in a nifty little drawstring bag with the logo printed upon it, which is perfect for storing or for transport. It's nice and keeps my beard looking good, so I am happy with it. I just wish I didn't have to distinguish between my hair and the brush's hair after every grooming.<br /><br />I received this beard brush for free in exchange for a genuine critique."
R3FE3QOKSDWI3X,Love it!,I love this gloss! My hair was always poker straight and very soft and shiny but all of a sudden the right side is curly and frizzy.

R29OSTFIPGLZDV,After a good clarifying shampoo my hair is back to normal,"The first time I used it, my hair looked amazing--so much so that I made a point of using it once per week. After a few weeks, I noticed that my ends were almost permanently dry when this was not the case before. I changed nothing else about my hair care routine during this time. To try and fix the dryness I did a few long treatments of this mask following the directions over the course of one day.The end result was sticky and waxy feeling hair. After a good clarifying shampoo my hair is back to normal, but it never felt sticky or waxy before using this product. I'm unsure if it was just a one-off strange case or if it was the product, but none-the-less, I regret paying the price I did for it. I have since achieved the same result without the buildup by using raw coconut oil--which I can get for the same price."

It does appear to have a good moisturizing effect that keeps the skin soft and smooth. The scent is pleasant and intriguing.<br /><br />The exotic argan oil content appears to be quite low as it's listed way back in the list of ingredients. Nevertheless, the spray still seems like a real treat to the skin, leaving it silky soft without a greasy feel. I'm glad that I have tried it."

Used it for the first time tonight, very excited because I love trying new natural products, and no matter how much conditioner i used or how long I left it, it didn't do what it's suppose to? Aka it did not condition, i had to fight to remove my tangles. I have fine curly hair, but a lot of it. It at least smells good, but I'm sitting here with wet hair that FEELS like straw, very upset on how much money I wasted :/"

R31Q8JL5FJ2NSM,Expired and Break outs,This is a as product made my forehead breakout and what upsets me the most is I bought it for 5.99 at Burlington coat factory. It was cheap and a week later I noticed that it expired on 7/2015 I'm upset that Burlington is selling expires products and this product would of been good but it was expired while I was using it. It has okay coverage for tan skin. But the smell is terrible well.. Maybe cause it was expired but after all I wouldn't recommend this product or Burlington lol
RBA2H9UWYLMNB,LOVE,I absolutely LOVE this color I mixed it with &#34;dusty rose&#34; and it's amazing I worked a 10 hour shift without re touching it besides when I ate a hamburger (bad idea with lipstick haha) and applied a small amount of Chapstick towards the end of my day. Love love love this brand and look forward to buying more colors.

R30BILRG8ZYH5D,I WOULD RECOMMEND!!! GREAT PRIME BEAUTIFUL COLORS..,I Really love the colors but mine came broken one side of the hinges were broken also a couple of the eyeshadow pots were broken. It was probably because it came in a box with other items; but I had to return it and I'm waiting on my new palette to come later on today.

BUY THIS PRODUCT U WON'T BE SORRY...
R2UI4AQTPIE6RZ,Hair Shampoo,I like this product very much
RJVIBCTNXU0TL,"I have long fine hair, and I loved it","I have long fine hair, and I loved it. I use to straighten my hair and it looks great. What I like the most of it is the fact that the material protects your hair from the damage the heat can do.  I have one from the babyliss line and its good cause I do my hair quickly but it doesnt protect my hair from the heat as this one does. Also, the curls you do with it look perfect.  The only con i can find is that I spend more time doin my hair with this straightner, but the difference in timing is not so big that I cant rate it 5 stars."
RSGDWO85QABSM,Best Shaver I've Used,"I purchased this item at a different store during a Fathers Day sale.<br /><br />When I first started shaving I used blades, and then quickly moved over to electric shavers, trying out the newest models at the time (A Norelco Quadra Action, and what I believe was a Braun Flex Control), I quickly decided that even though a foil irritated my face more it gave a quicker and closer shave compared to a Norelco, and I stuck with Brauns since then.<br /><br />Recently I've been unhappy with my Series 7, it constantly struggles to get sideways growing hairs near where my jawline begins and at least half of my shaving routine since 2012 has been dedicated to shaving them. I had become tired of this and as the foil wore out I went in search of a new shaver, The Braun series 9 was newly released and I thought of buying it since Brauns have served me well for the better part of two decades, but instead I decided to take a gamble and try a new rotary razor for the first time in nearly 20 years.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. The 9000 is a quantum leap from the quadra action of days past, the familiar slots are still there (though now in a V shape), but now with a huge open chasm with a comb to capture very (and I mean very it chews through a 5 day beard like nothing) hairs. The simple inward flex has been replaced with two individual pivot points on each head (vertical and horizontal) as well as a 360 degree flexing shaver assembly. All this flexibility means that with a light touch it simply floats around my face removing whiskers with robot kisses. Giving me a shave closer than my Brauns but with zero (as in I don't feel like I even shaved) irritation.<br /><br />Now to address a common misconception I hear hurled around about Norelco rotaries (They're under powered!). A rotaries blades move in a constant circle, meaning that they constantly move in one direction, while a foils blades move back and forth, meaning they have to change direction. You need a lot less power tokeep moving an object in one constant direction then you need to keep an object moving while constantly changing direction.<br /><br />An example: If I tell you to run in a straight line you can probably do this for quite some time, but If I tell you to run to a line, turn around, and run back to another line until exhaustion, you would probably tap out much earlier. Simply put, a rotary razor does not need as powerful of motor to keep it moving at an optimal speed."

RC8OC5BGAD1N1,Pretty color!,"This wig is super cute! I was kind of disappointed it was messed up at the top of the wig. Sort of unbrushed and tangled. Since I'm wearing a beanie over it, it's not a big issue. Other than that, it's awesome. (:"

I have two corgis, i use this to trim their paw fur and to trim their long furry hair around certain parts, works fantastic, isn't super noisy, and it holds a charge and works well. I am so happy with this purchase, i have a full sized wahl, but it is too noisy and they run like heck when they see it coming, this, i can hide and use, awesome!!!!"
ROQAEIZOBKKX4,Love my Lke Led lamp!,"This is our second ordet, we loved the first ones so much my nail tech  wanted a couple for herself. We like two for the nail tables so clients don't have to cross their arms. They set even the darkest gel polish quickly, very easy to clean with the steal finish inside and removable bottom!  If you are doing a new set of hard gel or repairing a nail that is down to bare I use the 5 sec setting to flash cure and thin layers of product in order  avoid heat spikes as these leds are very efficient. Also pay attention to hand placement! These lights leds are placed perfectly to cure so that there us no need to hold thumb flat as long as you don't shove hand in too far. I suggest taking removable bottom off to see. Also the light will start when you place the hand in and rest on bottom plate. My only wish was that it had an on off, it had to be unplugged to turn off."

RJBIASMRK7IHK,Five Stars,very good
RUZBXL33YYR95,Five Stars,Very good!
RZBQ2LWJ37HQC,Good stuff.,"First time trying the soap! It's a very generous amount for the price. About 1 inch thick and the bar was a little bit bigger than the size of a credit card. The scent is earthy but pleasant! It took a little bit to get used to but I'm in complete love with it now!<br />I've only been using it for a couple days so I can't say much for results. I'll come update it in a month or so with my findings.<br />Something worth mentioning is that a pea sized amount is plenty for your whole face and more! So I can see this bar lasting a while.<br />It doesn't really look like the listing. It's not round or cream colored (or a bottle of Dudu osun soap).<br />Honestly, it's a little ugly. But I don't mind!"
R28GU1DUYHEZX,Fantastic for dry heels,"I echo all the great reviews. I too have always suffered with dry cracked heels. I used this product once and knew it was better than anything I had ever used. You need to be careful as you can make your heels sore, even though it doesn't hurt while you're scraping, it will hurt after! I now only have to do my heels once a week (previously, I had to do them every day). I have now bought this product for other members of my family and they all think it's great."
R2Z4UAXDBHUND7,Loved this deodorant when I bought it in store,Loved this deodorant when I bought it in store. Something must have happened during storage or shipment because when it got to me it had a sandy and even sharp texture to it. Had to throw it out because the texture was irritating my underarms.

RAYE6UDJ6077Y,Would be 5-star product if it didn't rip when peeling from sheet,Lovely but the polish almost never peels whole from the sheet -- annoying to have it rip all the time. Goes against the idea of ease and simplicity.
R1DPS4M6HBK1LI,Amazing deal,"WOW, This set is amazing. One of the wooden handles fell out but its more than worth it I will add a bit of glue because these brushes are the most luxurious brushes I have had since sigma. Love them."
RYZFEIMBS200V,Was cheaper than at the drugstore,"Been using this product for many years, couldn't beat the price at the time so...  I have long, natural, thick African American hair. I stumbled upon this att cvs one day and thought I would try it. It has worked for me, but I don't put it on my wet hair and I just use a little to slick my hair back in a ponytail or bun. This keeps my hair sleek and no fly away strands especially on humid days. I would not recommend for all African American hair. My cousin's hair is a little coarser than mine. She used this after washing and it made her hair sticky and dried it out. I guess its about finding balance and what works for you. Worth a try, can't beat the price."

R27W36E50JN35Z,Tones down moonlight-white skin,"This stuff is GREAT. I have moonlight white legs that won't tan - but my arms tan - so I get very uneven. This product didn't make my legs look suntanned, instead it just gives them a nice &#34;flesh colored&#34; appearance - a more normal skin tone than my usual glow-in-the-dark white!!!! There is no streaking AND no build up of dark patches on your knees or ankles -- highly recommend for very pale folks who want some color"

R1Z5W8AVROCKXD,"Great value, great product.","his is a fantastic product at a great price. My favorite hair company is Devacurl and I feel this compares to their B'leave In gel. I give Devacurl a 5 and this is probably a 4.5 at less than half the cost.<br /><br />Please note that you need to use just a tiny, tiny dab of this. I have curly hair. After I've rinsed or washed my hair, I use a small dab of Alba's leave-in conditioner. Then I follow it with Alba's soft hold style cream (I wrote a similar review for Alba's leave in conditioner).<br /><br />Very pleased with this purchase. I think I paid a little less at Vitacost because I had a coupon."
RCXDXF1BCL3IU,Favorite product of the summer!,"New favorite brushes! After losing my brushes at a fashion show I needed to replace them and I'm so glad my makeup artist recommended these to me! I have very sensitive skin so I was really excited to find a brush set that is hypoallergenic. The weight is balanced really nicely for easy application whether you're a pro or a newbie. The brushes are soft, while still being quite precise. If you're breaking into the world of contouring, you'll have all the tools you need here to sculpt your face like a Kardashian! Also cheers to the company for doing a vegan makeup product and NOT testing on animals! Huge selling point for me!"

R1ALUR1WOHEXMO,"A real, unpaid review.","I paid actual money for this - unlike most of the reviews here which were given the item for free in exchange for a review.<br /><br />For starters, I have 3 other types of foot scrapers. Living in Arizona, if I neglect my feet and wear flip flops for a few months, my heels get all crispy. Nothing extreme, but not very sexy. I've used the ped-egg mostly - it works fine, and keeps the foot Parmesan mostly contained. The only problem is that it sort of takes forever to grind em down, and you're moving your arm the whole time so it gets tedious and tiring.<br /><br />I also have an expensive Clarisonic Pedi thing that's rechargeable - my problem with this is that foot Parm goes everywhere, and it stops moving if I touch it to my foot with any sort of pressure at all. So it's just really slow... and messy.<br /><br />Along with this review item, I bought a top rated microplane foot rasp... it's a cheese grater basically. It works a little better than a ped egg, but it's way messy - foot sawdust everywhere. Also, you gotta move your arm around and saw at your feet.<br /><br />I bought this Flex Neck Callus Remover because it had a 5 star review. My 2 star isn't going to change that, but hopefully someone sees this and thinks twice. Does it grind away your rough foot skin? I suppose it does sorta. The flex neck is pointless because if you use enough pressure to even start to bend it, the file stops moving. I mean, 2 AA batteries aren't gonna be enough to power this thing to actually do a good job. That said, it does kind of work. It's easily the messiest of the bunch though. Instead of a pile beneath you, it's throwing foot dust in all directions.<br /><br />Packaging is decent, and while it all feels sort of cheap, it isn't completely useless. I would have probably given it a 2.5 or a 3, but all the ace reviews paid for with a freebie or discount combined with the fact that it's just as weak as anything else I've tried means it deserves a 2.<br /><br />I would like to get one of these grinders that's borderline dangerous. I don't want to sit there gently touching this thing to my foot for 25 minutes while it slowly takes away all these layers. I want to get something that'll zap it off in like 2 minutes tops."

R2KUH54TTQ4WP8,"Works Well, Smells Bad","Works well as an aftershave in that it cleans and tones your skin after shaving.  Smell is subjective, but it smells rather horrible to me.  Smells like a fresh urinal cake.  As it dries it goes from fresh urinal cake smell to dirty urinal cake smell.  Thankfully the smell isn't very strong, and doesn't linger long (at least for me).  Smell upon application also depends upon one's own body chemistry.  Your experience may be better, or worse..."

R20H4TUUM6MINH,I was left with a terrible case of unsightly stretch marks---behind my knees,"This lightly scented oil is turning out to be one of my favs.  Honestly, I had never heard of it until about 2 weeks ago.  It's not an oil that my local coop carries, nor is it advertised anywhere.  So.....when I saw it in a review group that I'm in, I immediately Googled it.  I was so shocked at all of the claims that were associated with Certified Organic Baobob Oil.  Surely these claims are exaggerated!  I HAD to purchase a bottle.  When I was a preteen (I'm in my 40's now), I hit a rapid growth spurt.  As a result, I was left with a terrible case of unsightly stretch marks---behind my knees, buttocks area, upper arm and breast area.  I have always been self conscious about these areas.  Also, two years ago had a tattoo removed on my left arm.  Even tho all of the ink has been zapped out, the scarring still bears its ugly head.  Over the years, I've tried Cocoa butter as well as countless other oils to lessen the appearance blemishes.  I've never tried commercialized or harsh chemical peels because the long-term effects frighten me--Google it.  Yes, this may sound very, very odd, BUT Baobob Oil does not feel oily.  In fact, it feels light.  I have to ask myself, 'How can something that doesn't even feel oily be effective?'  Fast forward......After showering, I used it the first night I received it.  I noticed 2 things: 1). A little bit goes a long way.  2). My skin quickly absorbed the oil leaving very little oil left on my skin.  My skin does not feel greasy at all.  I awoke to extra soft skin.  However, having soft skin wasn't my goal.  Ha!  But, I'll take it.  I took my morning shower and used more oil.  I used more oil the 2nd night......and so forth.  I've used the oil for 7 mornings and 7 nights AND I can honestly say that I CAN see an improvement !!!  My skin is noticeably lighter.  In all honesty, I had planned to add this oil to my collection that didn't work.  This is definitely a front and center keeper.  As with all oils, keep them away from direct heat and sunlight light.  If I haven't reached my desired goal when this bottle is gone, I will be placing a second order.  I have received this oil at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
R2E9SZ460ZWFR1,Will purchase again,"I have purchased this oil in the past and I will purchase it again in the future. I diffuse it, use it in my laundry and make inhalers for the cold and flu season.  I have even put it in boiling water in our hotel room and let the germ fighting steam rise into the room. I have also made a room spray/linen spray with this germ-fighting oil."
R186H0U4WOTSR9,Baba Ramdev is doing noble work!,"Baba Ramdev's shampoo is made from real natural ayurvedic herbs that will nourish your hair and scalp. Get this one as I've seen his other shampoo's (ex. milk protein version, raathi, etc.) contain laurel sulfate, because in order to make them last overseas. In India, I doubt any of the Pantanjali shampoos have it, but I think in order to keep the shelf life alive, they add it. Still, this original one is pure and works well.<br /><br /> I feel Baba Ramdev is doing the best he can instructing his chemists and pharmocologist to create products based on ayurveda, but as a simple humble yogi, I think he is not aware of chemicals like laurel sulfate which are harmful and of the natural alternatives. Still, he is working hard to improve and provide natural products."

R24C2AYKFTU0AS,I love the way the system makes my teeth feel shiny ...,"Received this to try for free as a Bzzagent! Thanks to Crest for letting me be your guinea pig! I love the way the system makes my teeth feel shiny clean and as far as whitening toothpastes go this is one of the best I've tried. However, I still only noticed minor color change, definitely doesn't compare to professional dental whitening services. I noticed other reviews say it left white spots on their gums but I didn't notice that... Maybe they left it on too long?"
R86T7FGFFTVHI,"These brushes are tiny, and that's why I love them!","I got this set together with the eye set. Because I wear glasses and I'm very nearsighted, I like using short brushes. The mini eye brushes here are smaller than the normal eye set by EcoTools but not by much, maybe about an inch. I like to keep them together because that set comes with a case. The eyeshadow brush is much smaller than the highlighting brush from the EcoTools Eye set, but bigger and a little fluffier than the petite eye shading brush from that kit. It's my favorite to highlight the inner corners. The eyeliner brush was what really attracted me to the kit. The short handle makes it great to get really close and precise with gel liner, eyeshadow as liner, smudge pots type eyeshadow, etc. Finally, the powder brush is in my opinion a little too small to powder my entire face. I'm used to the ELF slanted kabuki for powder and I can't imagine myself changing to this one, even for travel. I like that it's very soft. I find myself using it for powder highlighter. It can work for powder blush but I mostly use cream blush and the ELF stipple brush. It's still useful but not my favorite of this group. But I feel like taking into account the price and how much I love that eyeliner brush, the fact that the powder brush isn't so big is not enough to deduct a star from this. Anyone who's ever hit the mirror with long-handled brushes from standing too close will appreciate this set as well as the eye set from this brand."

R3OUAQ7HMS9C3Q,I do not believe that these are truly Remi/human hair,"giving these 3 stars. I have alot of experience with extensions and these are very middle 50%... the hair is a great match to my hair but tended to look too shiny when styled so that it became obvious. I do not believe that these are truly Remi/human hair they feel incredibly synthetic, although they have been holding up to washing, curling, and straightening so no complaints there. For the price, these are exactly what you would expect. If you want to truly get a great match for human hair extensions you will pay atleast double..."

RNRVDXPB15XCF,Burned Fingertips are a Thing of the Past,"Have you ever straightened your hair and as soon as the flat iron plates run through your hair you grab it and then get burned?  It has happened to me more times than I can count.  That is why I am so happy to have the HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove.  I don't straighten my hair very often because I am in love with my bouncy curls but every once in a while I like a change.  This glove is great because it provides the protection I need to straighten my hair without burning my hands while I do it.  The glove is a bit big for my hand but it's very comfortable and easy to manage my hair while I use the flat iron.  It is heat resistant, not heat proof.  I feel a bit of heat through the glove but it is not uncomfortable or burning.  This glove have made styling my hair more manageable.  It is a good addition use with any heat styling tools.<br /><br />I have received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products. I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product."

R1I8PQUCEYRHU6,thanks Pixnor,My wife loves it
RX19V6WN55M8V,Nice sized bottle.,Just the right size for me to keep doggie shampoo in. Since I dilute the shampoo I can easily measure it into this and add the right amount of water.  It has a cap making it drip proof when I shake it before use. It also makes applying it to the fur so much easier since all I have to do is squeeze the bottle and I have much more control over how much to use.
R324XRETVZG7IH,Four Stars,It works well. The only problem is that the clipper is not smooth.
R3EP794AOF2XR,Save yourself time & money!!,"I ordered a roll of what was pictured. Instead i received a slice of a &#34;roll&#34; of masking tape that had been sawed into thinner rolls. The cardboard tube keeping the tape rolled is disintegrating and the tape is way to sticky to use as nail tape, it rips up the base coat of polish. I am extremely disappointed in this product and the sellers false advertising and poor product. Shame on me for not reading reviews."
R1TUGE8SSFA2OX,Five Stars,I love this soap!!!  It's a fun gift too
R1WP7P6EIO5C88,Works but Painful,"Works well, but I find it quite painful to use!"
R3T3ZXZXT13NWW,All around great brush,"This is the first boar bristle brush that I've bought, and from what I can tell it is definitely good quality. The handle feels sturdy and the brush didn't smell like anything out of the box. It's amazing how different my hair feels after brushing with this! It immediately smoothes my hair out. For me, I wish the bristles were longer (or maybe I should've bought a mixed bristle brush) because my hair is incredibly thick and it does not always go down to my roots. For people with thinner hair, this will be great. But for now, this will work just fine."

RTLXQCV6FGHV,Quick and Easy,"While on vacation I watched as a friend removed her unwanted lip hair with this product. She did it so easily and her lip was hair free. I have used tweezers to remove any hair that I found bothersome or unsightly, but after a while the tweezers leave marks. I used the wax. I heated it up and applied the wax with the supplied stick. It goes on warm. If feels really good. I let it sit on my lip for a few minutes and then applied the paper supplied in the box to my lip on top of the wax. I pressed the paper onto the wax smoothing the paper over my lip. Next I quickly ripped the paper from my lip. When I looked at the paper, there was wax and hair embedded inside. My lip was hair free and I was happy.<br /><br />You have to be really careful with the wax. It's not easy to clean from surfaces. To prevent the wax from dripping onto counters I roll the stick around until all the wax is seated on the stick. If you happen to let the wax drip near the top it will be hard to remove the top for you next use. The hardest thing with this product is making sure the wax only touches three surfaces, the stick, your skin and the paper. There is a finishing oil included. A dab of this will remove wax from your finger tips if they happen to come in contact with the wax. Although sticks are provided for wax application, it's not many. Your wax supply will far outlive the sticks. The paper sheets I cut in half. There are plenty."

R32TMN0WOZ4VYS,Five Stars,"Great oil for using with my essential oils!  Quick shipment, and great packaging. I would buy this again."
R251QSJT1LRYDB,I love this product,"I love this product.  It has stopped the process of daily shaving but still leaves me with smooth legs all the time.  I use this about once a week and find that to be enough to keep my legs smooth.  I will occasionally need to touch up around my knees mid-week but usually the one a week treatment is enough.  Yes, it does sting a little the first time but my skin quickly became use to the sensation and it doesn't bother me at all now.  Would recommend to anyone who desires smooth legs but hates the daily drudgery of shaving."
R3CAFKJXYHQAK0,REALLY WORKS FOR ME,"This is a wonderful product.  I am now 58 years old, and have had dry, sensitive skin all my life. I was concerned about all the lines developing on my face, and have tried a number of products.  Absorb health also sells a &#34;soft and healing serum&#34; which is an excellent product, and I have actually found that what works best for me is to combine the two.  I take half the jar of &#34;soft and healing serum&#34; and place it in another container, then add some of the hyaluronic acid to the serum. If I add too much of the hyaluronic acid, it will sting and burn the skin on my face, so I'm careful to only add about a third as much as the soft and healing serum. I stir the mixture with my finger every time I am going to apply it, to keep the two well-mixed. The extra acid seems to give the serum a big boost for my skin.  I have been told by numerous people that I look much younger than 58  -- and while I can't give all the credit to the Absorb Health products, they really do help a lot. I should write a review on a couple of other products I use that really help.  I'll try to do that soon.  (I also never use soap on my face -- I clean only with water.)"
R23N2CFB7YFABP,MADE MY ACNE WORSE,I recently bought this product directly from the body shop in lenox mall. I was told it would work best and i know the wonders of tea tree oil. I gave this face wash 3 weeks and my acne kept getting worse and i gave it more time to clear my face up and after using for 4 to 5 weeks my acne just got worse!!!! It was better before i used this product. My skin type is very oily(around the nose and under my eyes) and I must admit it did dry up the oily parts of my face with the toner and wash but my face produced way more acne in places I never really got acne such as my forehead. As I'm typing this right now acne is all across my forehead . I did investigate that if your looking for a very good facial wash to take acne away and prevent would be products with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. These ingredients are known as the products that work directly with your acne. The body shop tea tree skin clearing facial wash has not a single trace of benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. The only benefit of this wash is the magnificent smell of tea tree and the tingly feeling that i loved but a good smell doesn't take away these dang white heads. I paid a few bucks for my toner and facial wash and it sad i wasted money on something that really doesn't work with my skin type. Good luck on finding a fash wash.
R1YEA8HETOID3W,I use many Maybelline products so this was not the best one I have ever used,I thought it would be a little darker green. I use many Maybelline products so this was not the best one I have ever used.

R2IH2UI1I2J26N,A nice sugary scent but a bit old lady-ish..,"The &#34;warm vanilla sugar mist&#34; body spray is pretty good. The smell is sweet and nice, but not exactly the sugar cookie vanilla smell I was hoping for<br />But if you use this it's important to not overdo it, cause even though it has a nice sweet smell it kind of sometimes smells like old lady perfume...<br />And for that reason I don't really use it that much.<br /><br />I'm planning to order the &#34;Vanilla Bean Noel&#34; body mist, so I hoping it will be less old-ladylike and more of a freshly baked sweet cookie smell."
R3D63GYFM7DM24,These are one of the best products I have ever bought,"These are one of the best products I have ever bought, my hair is thick and if I don't use one of these, it takes forever to dry my hair."
R1X0GPI4Y6IFBM,Five Stars,Exactly what it said.

R28MCC3I9S1SCQ,I absolutely love it. Best BB cream I've had so far,I absolutely love it. Best BB cream I've had so far. My skin is oily and prone to breakouts. This product doesn't irritate my skin
R2D93AVG8RMKY6,Cucumber eye strips,This was not exactly what I thought I was getting with these individual eye strips but that was my fault for not doing the research when I ordered them.  They do help with bags under your eyes but dry out rather quickly when you are using them.
RM3ZLSSOFCKIW,Great item!,Great item!
R1X47WF5ONPH7H,Love it!,Never tried this brand before but it came on time and looked great. I can't wait to try it!
R2TKM2KSBA7I0N,Easy to use. Highly reccomend!!,Love these. Very easy to peel and apply stickers to really polish off a nail look. Add just a sticker to a French manicure and it adds that extra touch of fancy and cute!! It comes with lots of choices and stickers.

R1YPL2UUS7VBMV,Five Stars,Boss!
RF6H7WG5GZBQZ,Rose Water Pure - Love this product!,This toner is extremely gentle and the Rose fragrance so calming and refreshing at the same time.  I highly recommend this product.
R2DAUJBQ1IXQRR,liked old formula best,I really liked the foundation before the change... wherein the old formula blended very well with my skin color the new formula if too light and makes my skin look dried out and gives me the appearance of having too much make-up on.

I did have to take the side strips so I could put it in the case, but I did keep them so I could put them on if I go somewhere I take the case off and want my phone total bling. Fit great and easy to put on."
R12JB3B7TXLPS5,Excellent product,"These are great.  It takes a little effort to remove sparkly nail polish, but otherwise I love not having the acetone smell.  I do not have any complaints thus far, and would definitely purchase again."

R1SHYWABJNT61X,Bright White,"I was fortunate to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing & Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.  I have always used crest so I was thrilled to try this out. It comes with two different toothpaste you use them in the order they are marked. I have been using daily, but just one time a day. I love how white you can automatically see my teeth are after the usage.<br />I love how clean my teeth feel afterwards! Like they literally sparkle! There are no beads in it to get stuck under the gums; the smell is amazing and little burn. The process was easy to do i love the way it is numbered so no trying to remember which is first.<br />I love no strips to stick on the teeth!<br />I would like to add I do not smoke or drink excessive amounts of soda. So my teeth are not horrifically stained, so I am unsure how this will do for a person who has been smoking for many years or who drinks lots of soda, teas, or coffee. But I did see a very noticeable difference in my teeth in 4weeks."
R2B162W56JXNXZ,some of the were opened,It is ok. most of theme were not well closed. But is not a bad product. Really small though.
R3QK5J9R4WTU40,An oldie but a goodie,"This product has been the BEST for distracting insects & moisturizing skin for me since I was a child, plus is smells so much better than some of the nasty repellants. It's also a product I feel comfortable using on my dog & it moisturizes her coat at the same time.This is a true case of not recreating a wheel if it's not broken. SOS is the BEST."

R2MOQG3LTUYH3V,I like a multitasker!,"As a 50ish mom who's spent a good bit of time outside, I have been searching for a reasonably priced, multitasking serum for my combination skin that has hyperpigmentation. So far, I think I may have found a keeper (will need to update later on its effect on my spots). This serum has a nice weight - not too thin and absorbs well without leaving a &#34;tight film&#34; feeling that another vitamin C serum I tried did.  It is fine alone under makeup though I have fairly dry cheeks & forehead, so I add Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream over and at night I like a little more heft so I layer on some rosehip oil.  My skin feels dewy without the additions and I feel like I'm helping correct issues without harsh chemicals.  My only regret is that I didn't notice the package deal for the same price which included the eye gel - oh, well, maybe next time!"

RUH8NNQ5L0BAY,Amazing!!!,"This product is absolutely wonderful!!  I have used many different organic body creams and this one is at the top of the list.  This product is very versatile.  I use it as a lotion all over my body, as a more specific application to calluses or other extremely dry parts of the body and also as a lip butter.  In all of these different roles, it has been extremely moisturizing and left my skin and lips very hydrated and nourished.  Another key appreciation of this product for me, is that it is not greasy in the least bit and soaks into my skin rather quickly.  The scents are at the perfect degree, not too overwhelming but more of a subtle delight.  I can't wait for CaveLogix to create more products as I know I will stock up on all of those as well!!!!!"

R1HYYF1G5XBID,Five Stars,"I really do like the Cucumber Aloe Cleanser.  It is by far my favorite Wen product!  I have medium texted hair, but it has changed alot over the years, and especially as I've gotten older.  This is the only Wen product that I have used, that does not leave my head feeling greasy.  It cleanses well.  It does leave my hair feeling soft, as I do have dryer hair and am always trying to heavily moisturize the ends.  For me, I just add it to my hair at the beginning of my shower, leave it in while I do all my other things, and then just rinse it at the end.  But, before I get out, I do add 1 pump of it to the ends of my hair and just leave it in.  That has helped my hair alot.  Hope this helps you! :)"

RJTGLWUYUJDH2,Something That Actually Doesn't Smell Overwhelming and Cheap - Worth Every Penny,"My teenage son insists on Axe body spray but I really don't feel like paying retail prices in the store and the scents he has had in the past have been too overwhelming and actually gave me a headache (I am very sensitive to smell). This is honestly the first Axe body spray he has had that I can tolerate. The scent is not overwhelming to the point of being nauseating. It is actually a very nice and refined scent, something you would find in more expensive colognes. He likes the fact that it lasts all day. Unlike some of the cheaper brands that wear off, you can still smell this when he gets home from school even though he doesn't reapply it during the day. You do get what you pay for but for this product the price was very reasonable, so I am very pleased with that. Definitely worth the money. He got a three pack which should last him a while, but if this scent is still available when he  runs out I will definitely reorder this for him."

You bet you I'm getting my money back.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this stuff doesn't work. Because most people I've seen have passed with it. Bit I am going to say if your a heavy pot smoker.

R20T66D2GZURQ6,Three Stars,Found it a bit hard to handle because of the size
R12GMM7ZUSGSQG,Easy to apply and a great pigment!,"I got the deep brown hoping it would be my color... AND IT IS!!!<br /><br />The pigments are great, a nice color, and easy to apply with my eyebrow brush. I have been using Anastasia Beverly Hills dipbrow, and sometimes I will use Pacifica, but I have been wanting to get away from the dip brow because I don't like applying a wet feeling brow liner. It makes it somewhat difficult when I am putting on my finishing powder, and a few times the smear. OMG the smear... THAT will make a woman want to yank out her hair, especially after being done with everything and ready to get the day going, and then BAM. Smear... NOT a good way to start the day.<br /><br />This was easy to apply and a little goes a LONG way. The pan may not seem that big but when I lightly swatched it I got the perfect pigment so I know this will last a LONG time.<br /><br />I was able to do both brows with the same light stroke of powder and that is great in itself. The arch was easy and perfect, which hello. YES. The foundation I applied to clean up was minimal and that is a new one also. With the dipbrow, it's usually another few minuted tacked onto the daily look. So I am REALY happy with how easy to apply this was!<br /><br />I am sooo glad I got the right color cause this is an amazing powder.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate. I chose to do the review on my own."

R3L1MR5M6J8WG5,Very good Product,"Not the same as some 100% pure Lanolin products that are for some uses too gummy or solid. Still a bit sticky but is better than some 100% pure Lanolin products for ease of use. Bought and tried several different brands of 100% pure Lanolin products. This brand is the easiest to use because of the added ingredients consistency with a little perfume smell. IT IS 'Compounded with 100% Pure LANOLIN'.

R1IXBOEWX4S3T1,Mild flavor and works great,"I love this toothpaste!!!! It makes my teeth noticeably whiter after just one use, but what I love the most is its very mild flavor. Minty toothpastes make me gag, which makes me want to brush my teeth less. This one has a very mild mint flavor and feels very smooth on my teeth. It's more like a thick gel than a paste."

RYWKR631HNHK2,"Wonderful for fine hair, but use sparingly. Smells amazing","THIS is the perfect spray for fine curly/wavy hair.  I style my hair in the morning and sometimes no matter what I do the back still has a bit of frizz or undefined curl.  I mist this lightly on the back of my hair, scrunch and wah lah.. the curls are defined.  You can use it as a revitalizer after a day of being out and your curls let go, but I use it as a styling product in the morning. The smell is wonderful and a big bottle of this is going to last me a very long time. One tip, use sparingly on your hair until you know how much to use. Too much makes your hair slightly oily. Once you use it a few times you'll know how much you need. For my hair, 2 sprays or so on the back and I'm good to go!"

R3PY9PV78GUBXT,"I love Radha Beauty products, always satisified","This  Argan Oil, came in a little blue glass bottle that also came with a dropper. I really like the style of these bottles with the blue tint and pretty white writing. While doing research I read that tinted bottles preserve the freshness of oils, so that is a plus from Radha Beauty products.The description on the bottle said, ” Radha Argan Oil is 100% pure and certified organic. This oil is extracted from the nut of the argan tree, then first cold-pressed to protect its revitalizing and hydrating properties. Radha Argan Oil can be used for many areas including hydrating and nourishing hair & skin, as a daily moisturizer, skin treatment, and treating split ends.”  I like to use this on my hair and skin. I especially like this as a cuticle soften for my finger nails an toes nails."

R1FMAQ76Z4H50T,Five Stars,Work very well for very small openings.
R1RHOKCS2DEL98,Ponytail is too heavy so it doesn't stay on head.,"While the quality is very nice, the weight of the ponytail makes it almost impossible for my child to wear.  It just falls off of her head.  It doesn't do much better on mine.  It would have to be well secured by Bobby pins, and I wasn't wanting something that complicated. This makes it and it's adjustability worthless to me.  Bummer."

R26IEN69LKWEDJ,By far my most favorite of the essential oils,"By far my most favorite of the essential oils.  I have purchase every oil I have found and could purchase related to sinus, cold and breathing and I just reorder more because I am so afraid of running out.  I have not had a sinus problem since using this.  I have had chronic sinus problems my entire life living in the humid south.  I use to wake up with a headache every morning , but not anymore.  I have not had to take a sinus tablet since I have been using this.  I apply 2 or 3 drops to the filter of my cpap machine, I have also put 2 drops into the water instead of the filter.  Either one works fine for me, I do apply the oil to the filter more so now.  I love this product so much I purchase several for friends.  I have mixed this with carrier oil and applied to the grands, place on cotton balls for inhalation, but since I have the cpap just the use at night has been all I have needed. I am amazed at how it works and how it has became my favorite scent, because I have tried all the famous brands but this formula is just what pleases me and more importantly what works.  Good bye stopped up nose since I have used this product and I will not run out.  I hope it works as well for you as it does for me."

R392IPKREX9667,So happy I got this mask for less,"So happy I got this mask for less! I am a huge fan of eminence products and I decided to get the whole thing after my esthetician gave me a sample . It definitely works  great for those hormonal breakouts around the chin and neck. It is an instant boost for the skin illuminating, clearing and giving it that glow ;).

R2I0B2MQDQ7O3B,Adjustable temperature control,"I had previously ordered a flat iron from Groupon goods, but misunderstood the description that said heats up to 450 degrees.  I 'assumed' that meant the temperature was adjustable.  That was not the case.  I saw this one on Amazon and decided to give it a try since it was the same brand.  This one was actually cheaper too (or the same price).  I love that the temperature IS adjustable on this one.  Love the fast FREE 2 day prime shipping as well.  Took about 2 weeks to receive the other one from Groupon."

My hair is straight as a board!
R32WM0KKMZSNY3,Awesome for flourescent roots!,"First time coloring my own hair. Lets just say that while my hair is a very dark brown, I should have considered that greys are white and therefore would require a different color than the rest of it. I had flourescent orange roots, then an awful hued pink, and finally a nicely faded strawberry blonde halo around my temples and forehead. My husband got a lot of laughter out of this. None of it is the products fault, all my own, but I wanted those who are as inexperienced as I to consider the woes of coloring roots before purchasing :)"

It works very well for them, as it is very useful getting loose hair off neck, etc."
R1E8F2XX42NNRF,My go to for my skin!,"If you're looking for an all-natural and high-powered skin care product, look no further than the addition of rosehip oil to your beauty routine. This bottle has to be one of my favorite bottles of Rosehip I have boughten because of its pump. Normally when I have boughten others they comes with a dropper and truthfully it's a pain! I don't put any products on my skin whatsoever unless they are an all natural product. I mix a few of my oils together for a twice daily face &#34;cream.&#34; Yes I know oils are not a cream but wasn't sure how else to explain it. Rosehip oil is one of the key ingredients that I put on face because of all its benefits. I have a face that glows bright and my skin is never dry.<br /><br />Rosehip oil packs a powerful punch of moisture for dry or mature skin, which can help reduce the appearance of wrinkle) and age groups and can be used for many skin concerns like, wrinkles, scars and burns, dry and sensitive skin. Its also great for your hair and nails, truly is a great all around oil. Rose hip oil comes from the seeds of a specific variety of rose, Rosa aff. rubiginosa or Rosa moschata. A cold-press extraction method separates the oil from the hips and seeds. For facial skin care, rose hip oil offers several benefits when applied externally due to its primary constituents: essential fatty acids, vitamin E, vitamin C and B-carotene, a form of vitamin A.<br /><br />Nail health isn't exactly a part of your skin care routine, but regularly dabbing a bit of rosehip oil on your nails and cuticles will prevent hangnails and nail breakage.<br /><br />The anti-aging benefit from using rose hip oil on your face comes about due to the antioxidants and the oil’s ability to penetrate into deeper layers of skin. The vitamin C antioxidants stimulate collagen production, according to the Cleveland Clinic. It also helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles. The oil can penetrate due to the vitamin A, which has small enough molecules to go deeper into the skin. Vitamin A improves the skin’s moisture levels and reduces wrinkles and fine lines. The essential fatty acids in rose hip seed oil can help reduce scarring and promote skin regeneration.<br /><br />Make bad hair days a thing of the past by simply warming up some Rosehip oil in a bowl (it shouldn’t be too hot, it should be slightly warm and comfortable to touch), then massage it into your hair and scalp. Leave for about an hour and then wash thoroughly; you’ll be left with soft, revitalized hair. If you want to reinvigorate your hair and put the shine back into your locks, then Rosehip oil is just the ticket. Massage in slightly warmed up Rosehip oil before you wash your hair and it will bring back the shine to permed, colored or dull hair. Rosehip oil is rich in vitamins and this makes it ideal for adding bounce and silkiness back into limp, lifeless hair. Rosehip oil is proven to help with dandruff and other similar scalp conditions. Simply massage pure Rosehip oil into the scalp, leave it on for 30 minutes, then shampoo and see the difference it makes. I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own."

R8XWPM677DMS1,"Contains 3 sunscreens, solid 20 SPF, makes my skin seem oily though","This seems mainly to be a sunscreen, SPF 20. it is a white cream in a pump type dispenser.  I really like the packaging, it is very easy to use and dispenses just the right amount.<br />The product is a bit greasy though. It makes my face very shiny.  My product was very fresh, with an expiration date about 2 years in the future.  I thought that this was going to be a daily product, but I'd probably only use this if I knew I was going to be out in the sun a good bit.  It has 3 different sunscreens in it, 3% Avobenzone, 5% octisalate, 5% Octocrylene, that's where the 'Triple Power&#34; claim is from.  I mention that because I thought it maybe had 3 functions for skin, but no, it mainly just seems to be a sunscreen."

R2N4U9T9YONTTM,"Easy, comfortable, effective","After years of fumbling around with less-than-stellar clippers for my beard, I bought this yesterday. It was delivered the same day, and upon receiving it I immediately plugged it in to charge it. In less than an hour, it was ready to trim my two-week-old beard. I set it for the closest setting, and was amazed at how smoothly it glided over my face, while still cutting close enough to give me the stubble look I prefer when I trim (1-2 week intervals are normal for me).<br /><br />Previous clippers either tore my face to shreds or didn't do much of anything at all. (Note: it may be possible that I was not properly using some of these other devices, but that's another virtue of this one - it's hard to do it wrong with the attached comb.)<br /><br />If you're looking for an effective, affordable way to trim your beard, you can't go wrong with this product."

I like that it also moisturizes because I have very dry skin. It is a nice sized tube and a perfect color and should get me through summer just fine. I like it enough I'd probably buy it for winter days when I don't want a heavy foundation.
R2YJMA74DC08MB,Five Stars,Great product...will purchase again

R1ESWEE54P2CQ8,Great product heavy duty thick creamy consistency but when applied ...,Great product heavy duty thick creamy consistency but when applied it dryes to a powder kind of feel but definitely not drying it's a great consistency that stays on long easy to buff in with a brush or apply with beauty sponge I like to apply with my fingers and just dab and pat it where I want it then set it with a powder I find it sets it longer tho this product alone is very long wear but I do find that this products makes me a bit oily through out the day which is why I stopped using it a lot I used to use it all the time I finished my skin tone in the pallet this pallet is very versatile if u are fair skinned u can use the darker colors for cream contour like I did and the pink tones for cream blush and lip color and for the ladies of darker skin color the fair colors are great for a hilight and pink tones as blush or lip color and for all with dark under eye circles the pink tones and samon color is great to conceal that over all this is a great product I would recommend but I think it is best for those with dry to normal skin I have combination oily and as I said through out the day it makes me oily but overal it's a good buy
RPYIFCDHL0YPX,Five Stars,I used to wear this a lot as a teen and now im going back to it.

A simple product that works well but not the best that I have ever seen."

R17OLKMICH2087,Five Stars,Saved my teeth when i misplaced my retainer.
RZ0EP0PGNY7SR,Worked Poorly and Broke Quickly,"I have a plug-in Remington trimmer - and it is awesome, but this battery-powered trimmer is terrible.  The blades don't go quickly enough to cut well.  On my unit, the battery only ever lasted about 5 minutes.  That time steadily decreased, and now the trimmer is dead - it will switch on for a few seconds and then grind to a stop.  Maybe I got a defective unit?"
R1G700Q5CIB4EX,I have been waiting to do a review to see how I liked it after using it for awhile,"I bought one of these and received it about one week ago.  I have been waiting to do a review to see how I liked it after using it for awhile.  I was pretty skeptical at first, as when I pulled it out of the package it was hard as a rock (activated charcoal, duh, don't know what I was thinking).  I got it wet (get it soaked), and it turned into this soft sponge.  Okay, I can use this on my face.  So, I gently scrubbed away on my face, but you don't have to be real gentle, it is really soft.  The contour is good for getting all the places on your face.  Got out and moisturized and went to bed.  The next day I was touching my face and thought, wow my skin is feeling really soft.  Didn't attribute it to the sponge at the time.  The next day same thing. This is where I was like, hmm, what's up?  Oh, the sponge.  I have what I call chicken bumps on my upper arms, I used it on those yesterday and I am anxious to see if it helps eradicate those.  Wish me luck."
R3OC7UR41DOCKJ,Five Stars,Great non-permanent color.  They discontinued.  Happy to find this.  Doesn't leave hair dry.
RXD4CAXAQULM1,No more hair be gone!,"I ordered this for myself and my husband.  I know it says &#34;for men&#34; but I want to try if it would be effective on women as well.<br />The product is as pictured.. I thought this would be greasy, but it's not! It has a very nice citrus and lavander smell.  We apply it at night after shower.  Massaged it on affected areas to have it fully absorbed.  I am very excited and looking forward with the results. I will update in a few days  with regards to the outcome.  I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
RP4MPUXXCFAIC,It is very pretty and light enough for daily use,"I was looking for a floral scent and remembered liking this when I smelled it years ago.  It is very pretty and light enough for daily use, I just wish it lasted longer."
RCCXFA2WSSBPW,Nicely designed and excellent quality but still need to touch up with a manual razor most times,"I've had some experience with electric shavers over the last 25 years, including a Braun shaver back in 1989, which was pretty good if you shaved every day but couldn't handle more than a day's worth of growth. I gave up on electric shavers for a while because I still had to go back an go over some areas with a manual razor. I gave electric shaving another shot when BzzAgent and Braun sent me the new Braun Series 9 (9090cc) shaver to review. The 9090cc is &#34;Braun's #1 with Intelligent Syncro Sonic Technology.&#34; Braun states that the Series 9 is their best ever in efficiency and comfort. I was excited to have such state-of-the-art shaving technology.<br /><br />First off, this model is waterproof but is not designed to be used in the shower. One thing to note about using electric shavers is that you need to give it at least a week so your face (and beard) get used to it. The shaver head can get a little hot on your face (not so hot that it burns) but there's definitely some friction with your skin as it's cutting the hairs. My first observation was that the Braun 9090 has a large shaver head and covers a lot of surface area - great if you have a large face and you're making quick passes over large areas but for me it felt much too big. Two foil heads (OptiFoil) and two trimmers (lift & cut and direct & cut) made this shaver somewhat cumbersome. I liked the flexibility of the shaving head and also the option to lock it in a variety of positions (I think 5), which is useful on certain areas of my face. The foils and trimmers all float freely with the contours of your face.<br /><br />The Braun 9090 has a nice design and feel, and there's no doubt that it's built of quality materials with precision fit and finish. The blue LED display, power button and ergonomic feel really screamed &#34;quality.&#34; Bonus points for including a really nice travel pouch! The unit charges quickly using the power cord and also charges when it's in the clean & charge station. I was a little skeptical of the clean & charge station; another thing on my countertop and cleaning cartridges that I now have to buy. This was pretty new to me, as none of the other electric shavers I've owned had a cleaning station. To my surprise, I really liked the clean & charge station. My shaver was spotless and dry after a cleaning cycle, and it had a pleasant, refreshing smell. According to Braun, it also lubricates the shaver with each cleaning. Very nice feature despite the periodic cost of the cleaning cartridges.<br /><br />So how did it work? Well, as I expected (for past experience), I got a close smooth shave with some missed spots on my neck and jaw line. After a few minutes of operation and multiple passes on my face, the shaver head got a little warm with the 10,000 micro vibrations that Braun claims. They also claim that there 40,000 cross-cutting actions per minute but I still had some trouble spots after multiple passes. For the record, I only shave down with a manual razor and can get a reasonably close shave without irritating my skin by shaving up against the grain. I had to keep that in mind because with any electric razor, you're shaving &#34;up,&#34; which should result in a closer shave.<br /><br />The following day I noticed that I had a bit of razor rash, some of which looked like pimples, around my chin, mustache and mouth. Fear not - I was going to give this a week or two until my sensitive skin could tolerate this new shaving method. With each passing day, the shaver left a little less noticeable irritation to my skin. I used the Braun 9090 each day to tackle my medium-heavy beard with just a day's growth. By the first weekend (and 6 uses), I took a day off and gave my face a rest. The following day, I used the shaver and found that it plowed through the extra growth in the larger area of my face but couldn't handle the tight spots near my sideburns, underneath my jaw and my neck. That's not to say it missed it all, but it was definitelyspotty. I honestly think if the shaving head was smaller, it would work a little (or a lot) better. But I don't have a giant face and I would imagine the Braun would have a hard time on a really angular face as well. It took about the same amount of time as shaving with a manual razor, so there was not convenience benefit beyond just getting a dry shave and not having to use water or shaving gel.<br /><br />So would I recommend it? It depends. If you like a hot shave in the shower, than no. This is not a wet/dry shaver. If you shave every single day and have a medium to light beard, then yes. If you have a small face or a heavy beard, then it's a toss-up. You'll probably have to make a couple quick passes with a manual razor to do a little more &#34;clean-up.&#34; The Braun Series 9 9090cc is a quality product in every regard. As someone who likes to shave in the shower when the steam can open my pores, the Braun was a change to my routine but something I was willing to do for convenience and for a closer shave. My biggest gripes are the size of the shaving head, no wet usage, and patchy spots in tough areas.head was smaller, it would work a little (or a lot) better.

They had become weak and bendable, and whether that is due to aging or to nail polish use too often, I don't know.  I do know that after using this for a couple of weeks twice daily, my nails are stronger and have stopped splitting, so I really do recommend it.  It does feel a little greasy, but absorbs within a few minutes.  If you put it on just before bed, you won't even notice the greasy feel anyway."

I ordered the first container of this product and saw an improvement in the texture and coloring on my legs.  I liked the product so much that before it ran out I ordered another bottle.  The second bottle arrived and it was not the same consistency or color as the initial bottle, nor were the results the same. Repeated contacts to their customer service only referred me to Amazon for a refund, but it was beyond the 30 days in which Amazon honors refunds.  Don't spend $67.00 on this, get the Jergens lotion with color and save yourself headaches and cas!"

R1NT2IDOXLZEO2,BEST HAIRCLIP EVER!!!!,This stays in place it's beautiful and doesn't pull hair you barely notice it's in. I used this at 6 flags all day it didn't move. My first clip I got 8 years ago it is faded but still works perfectly.
R1ER3R4ZAZKG6E,Just as effective as Retin A but more gentle,"Ive been using vivant Exfol A for about 7 years, starting with level 1 and working my way up to level 3. I actually was a test subject for Dr. Fulton, the dermatologist who created them. Fun fact: He was one of the creators of Retin A and designed his own line with a more gentle version of vitamin A (something about molecule size I think). I used to use Retin A as a teenager and got the flaky skin that goes along with it, so I can attest to the fact that this is more gentle yet just as effective. Im giving it 4 stars (would do 4.5 if I could) because it doesnt clear my acne up 100% (and retin A didnt either, I have stubborn moderate acne according to my dermatologist), but it clears it up about 90% and is the best topical product I've used that doesn't have pesky side effects. Im sure I could clear up my skin 100% with benzoyl peroxide, but I'm not willing to deal with dry flaky skin and bleaching my towels and pillow cases."
R3QZR3WDVFZAWC,Good for Non sensitive teeth,I was offered to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing & Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent. I have been trying this product for few weeks now and feel like a can form an opinion to share with others.<br /><br />About the time i received the product i heard about blue plastic beads in some crest toothpaste and was concerned if this was did. I checked and Crest 3D White does not has them. Looking at the ingredients I was worried about the hydrogen peroxide in the whitening polish as i have sensitive teeth. The peroxide did give me some cold sensitivity and i have used it less then the recommended amount and it was better.<br /><br />Over all i feel my teeth are brighter and for people with no sensitivity may like it better. It is a good product to maintain the whiteness of your teeth form daily tea and coffee discoloration.

I had just stepped out of the shower so I took it as an opportunity to use this dusting powder. The scent is lovely! The poof is of high quality and very soft. It really made me feel pretty and luxurious. The container is much larger than I expected and they didn't skimp on the amount of powder included. Lovely product and a classic design from a classic designer.

R1LXLVB7CHQY2R,By Far The Best Whitening Product I've Used,I have used so many types of whitening products and I was skeptical of this one. I was given this product free of charge by Crest to try and give honest feedback.  I was absolutely blown away by the results. Whitening products I've used in the past have worked well enough but they always took the shine away from my enamel- making my teeth look chalky. This product whitens as well as anything I've ever used and made my teeth shiny as if they'd just been polished at the dentist. I was excited when I saw the price of it in stores. I will not be without this product. I love it!

I read a lot of reviews about NYX's Taupe blush being a good contour color for pale or fair skin, and I'm happy to report that they were absolutely right! I'm so glad I bought this; it's a beautiful, natural looking color that isn't too dark or too light - it's perfect. It's blendable and also buildable if you do fancy a darker or more striking contour. But it's very pigmented and I find that a little goes a long way, so you don't need a whole lot on your brush - a light hand will do. The blush itself has a very silky texture and it's totally matte; there's no glitter or shimmer in it. The only somewhat negative thing I have to say about it is the packaging is quite small for the price. Other than that, I'm mighty impressed with NYX and I hope they continue to make this Taupe blush for all the pasty ladies like myself that want a decent, natural contour. I would highly recommend to anyone considering purchasing it! :)"
R24MSSH2C88B5V,I love this brush,I love this brush.  I plan to order a couple more to have one at work and one in my ride too.  It is a high quality brush I use for my bodacious beard.  Good stuff!

R2D98U014E4YNT,Good for the money,"The appliance works as advertised, but the adhesive tape isn't holding very well on my tile wall.  So, make sure you have a shiny smooth tub wall to put it on."
RUZOS4VRO434J,Great tooth brush from Oral-B at a terrific price!,"Fabulous tooth brush!  Very easy to use, long lasting on a single charge, Oral B Pro does a terrific job!<br />I have been using an Oral-B tooth brush for almost 10 years.  My previous Oral-B rotating brush lasted for over 9 years, I just replaced it with the updated version at a much better price than I paid 10 years ago.  Highly recommended- my dental checkups are always quick and easy - my dentist told me to keep doing whatever it is that I have been doing."
R3RVFTULQ5NCBB,Decent,"BzzAgent sent me this product for free to test it. I started using this Crest whitening set on 08/01/15. There was a slight lightening in color. If I had to guess I would say they are about two shades lighter. That is not a lot of change for a month of use, but I appreciate that my teeth all look the same color. My fear was the regular teeth would look much whiter and brighter than the teeth with fillings. Some whiteners irritate my teeth or gums, because they are too strong. This two-step system was gentle enough that I can only recall one time where my teeth felt uncomfortable. It was the first time I brushed after my professional cleaning. The sensitivity was either from cut gums or related to the professional fluoride treatment I used. Who knows! Next time, I will skip whitening immediately after a professional cleaning. While I appreciate the opportunity to try this product, it is nothing I would purchase. It technically worked, but it did not show me enough results to justify the cost."
R1U3FNDUIYKE9N,Great company,I have been extremely happy with this company and their product line. It's the best price and the best products I've found.

R1WZJA6O3NW3G2,It's like a drink for your face!,"I have naturally dry skin but this makes it feel much healthier. Still looking for an astounding moisturizer to match this awesome wash. Hopefully, they can help me with that too!"
R13C6MW88JWJDD,Don't Sweat It!,So far so good! I say that cause I sweat  a great deal.  I was using Sweat Blocker. But it had been giving  me a rash and not working as well after a while. The price keeps going up. Sweat Sheild Ultra feels less harsh on my skin the smell isn't as strong.  Also I can use it without deodrante as well. I keep smelling myself to make sure I'm odor free. Its a great feeling to know I'm dry. If this was sold in the store it would great!
R130W8ALGWKQY4,Love this!,"I love this facial cream!! It always makes my face feel super smooth after I use it!<br />I have been using this cream for the past year now... although it is a little pricey, it is most definitely worth it!"

R1GARZ5TUALE8F,MY LASHES ARE GROWING!,"I lost some lashes because I had eye surgery a couple of years ago, the bald spot really troubled me.

I am applying the product twice a day, morning and night.  IT WORKS!  It's exciting."

R1HO42JPHZZ9Q5,Four Stars,Excellent
RWIH9QQFOXEIJ,This is by far my favorite facial mask,"This is by far my favorite facial mask. it almost drys to the point that it' un-noacable so there is less worry of someone seeing your oster face. It's also not as stiff as I've had other masks get leaving your face feeling flexable and not like it's going to break in the drying process.<br /><br />it rences really clean and refreshing.<br /><br />My acne is noticeably calmer using these reseliney Acne lines<br /><br />I received a promotional discount on this product, however, my reviews are always honest and unbiased regardless of price I paid."
RXX5HKGLD4ML7,good stuff!,Potent smell but works great to clear up toenail fungus. Also works well on minor skin irritations or sores.
R3DU9V3G9F3TH4,Good Mascara for a Low Price,"I was surprised to find such a good mascara for such a low price! It doesn't thicken my lashes, but it lengthens them and makes my eyes look beautiful without having to apply false eye lashes. The mascara goes on wet, so after a few minutes of being careful not to blink too hard, I have beautiful lashes. Absolutely worth a try!"
R2853ZKJ500RTX,It really work for me.,"It was my first time to used cava root, and it works great,  I did follows some review direcctions about take it  with warm milk and I did added  a spoon of cocoa, and 3 tbsp of sugar. Warning-- it was to much cocoa and  it tastes bad, but it worked for me and my insomnia, and I wake up fresh at morning."
RTWIZGJ5EL2JN,dissatisfied,These came and were horruble and unusable and i am very unsatisfied
RZXXWGVTGWHT6,Great for Homemade Lotion,"This 100% pure jojoba oil is much better than others, in the fact that it doesn't have an unpleasant smells. There is a faint odor that is reminiscent of a subtle flower smell, but nothing overpowering. This works great as an ingredient (or standalone) lotion as well as for other homemade products like hair pomade.<br /><br />Great product with fast shipping: 5 stars."

R2APOLK21BUM15,Five Stars,These were great and you really couldn't see through them.
R5X2WN82DNJ7P,Did nothing to my hair,"It didn't take away my bassiness of my bleached hair for a silver color, I used it every other day for 2 weeks and still maybe seen half a shade of lightening when I have seen an extremely platinum/silver tone to other people's hair with just using a purple shampoo. Also, IF YOUR TRYING TO STAY AWAY FROM SULPHATES-- they are the first 2 ingredients in the shampoo, which strips your color, SO IF YOUR HAIR IS ALREADY SALON DYED SILVER, THIS IS JUST GOING TO REMOVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU PAID FOR IN NOT 3 WASHES, NOT 2 WASHES, BUT 1!!!!!!"

R1M0QWUUUHWLF9,With practice it gets easier to apply the eye tattoo ...,With practice it gets easier to apply the eye tattoo transfers but it does take time at first.<br />I got some really interesting results by using makeup to color in the tatoo once it was applied.
R2JUNB4DT2TWJ6,Not a fan- way too much alcohol,"Usually I won't buy anything that doesn't have the ingredients clearly listed, but I bought this anyway because of all the great reviews it got here.  Big mistake!  One of the primary ingredients in this sleeping pack is alcohol, which my skin does not appreciate.  Alcohol is listed third among the ingredients, and the mask smells strongly of it.<br /><br />I used this mask once on a small area on my face (forehead only) in the hopes that I might be able to tolerate it, but when I washed it off the next morning, the skin on my forehead was dry and very itchy.  I'll still use this on my feet or something so it doesn't go to waste (maybe overnight while wearing socks since this sleeping pack is so thick), but I won't be putting this anywhere near my face again.  Good thing this was so cheap, or I'd probably be more disappointed.<br /><br />(And in case you're wondering why I didn't research the ingredients before buying... I definitely tried to!  I couldn't find anything online, and the Amazon user who asked for the ingredients on this product page was unanswered until I responded with the list from the back of the bottle.)"

RF7BRYULWBU5Q,"Longtime Norelco user, but can't recommend this model","After 30+ years using Norelco shavers, gotta say I'm disappointed by this model. Normally, when I get a new shaver, one of the great benefits is getting a faster, closer shave than my old Norelco, whose battery and heads have worn down. But shaving with this model is not as close and is even SLOWER than my old Norelco.<br /><br />I don't know if this is mainly due to different heads or whatever as another reviewer suggests (though I don't see any difference from my previous shaver), but I suspect the switch to a Lithium Ion battery has something to do with it. I was eager to switch to Li-ion, and the charging is faster and more convenient, but the heads don't seem to spin as fast, and so the shave isn't as close. It's more like how the shave was on my old Ni-Cd Norelco when the battery was nearly run down.<br /><br />Maybe the voltage on the Li-ion battery is different and that's the reason, IDK. I have no idea whether this affects all the new Li-ion Norelcos or just this one, but I can't recommend this model."
R1HSKSLP7JE2SU,Four Stars,Worth the $13
R1LN1CVSPAR7MG,Gorgeous beyond belief,"As always, there is no disappointment with Kat Von D. The pigmentation is always top notch and the texture is so buttery and applies flawlessly. It lasts all day with an eyeshadow primer on under it and looks just as good when I get home from work as it did when I left for work in the morning. The color choices in this palette are great and make for some pretty wonderful blends and shading. You can make so many different looks with this palette it's unbelievable. I use a double ended shadow brush to apply and blend them and it works awesome!"
RZA62583KG93Q,GREAT STUFF!,Love this stuff! Have been using for over a year (I have very curly hair) and it smells and works great!
R1F97F05VQ7ZM1,Removes impurities!,"I removed 10 years of impurities from my face with this set of tools. I had bought similar tools before but NONE where as effective as this one. This set of tools is great to remove blackheads and unclog pores without the swelling or irritation. I used it to remove blackheads from my cheeks. I have sensitive skin so I was extra cautious. My face was a little red after using the tools but soon it was back to normal. I cleaned my face first then, used a hot wash cloth to help open my pores and make it easier to remove the blockage. I received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
R6MCBTU4XE88I,Works great,I use this after exfoliating and it really works to help diminish pore size. A little is all you need.

R10S7JTW3Q4OT8,Good transfer paper,"My bf is a Polynesian tattoo artist. I always end up buying these same tattoo transfer sheets for him.<br />According to him, these are the most simple, yet best transfer sheets you can get. Just don't get them wet. Also, it transfer the stenciling onto the skin nicely without irritating the skin."

R1V3FLZFP4ZLTH,Tropic Isle JBCO Hair Food,The best hair food I've come across in a very long time. I love how my scalp feels after moisturizing and massaging it in. My hair is soft and shiny. I will keep this product in my hair care regimen.
R3RLDLXUCOLU5W,The smell is the best out of all of the other old spice body ...,Its so much cheaper on amazon than in stores.  The smell is the best out of all of the other old spice body washes and the scent lasts all day.
R2TXWA17MOPS18,and none of them work great. The scraper thing made my nose bleed,"Some on the holes are off center, and none of them work great.  The scraper thing made my nose bleed.

R2L89BD1LPWAHQ,stock pile this stuff!,"Suffer from pcos and have had horrible acne for several years now. I have tried everything and anything with no results.  After just a few days of using this I'm in love. Not 100% results but around 85% which is much more than other products. I put a thin layer on and sleep with it.  Amazing.  Now I just need something to help with my super oily skin,  ance marks,  and humongous pores..."

R1O49KSRB4Q0KP,Highly pigmented but terrible formula,"I tried this lipstick in Phantom Pink and I love the color and it's highly pigmented. However, it doesn't last long or apply evenly.

R24NW150J4IJZX,Very Pretty Rings,I received all 30 rings earlier than the estimated delivery date. There is a fair amount of variation in stone color and ring design. A few of the bands were slightly bent but not enough to be very noticeable. They varied in sizes from 6-9. They're sorted according to size (increasing left to right) in the attached picture.

R3BQ1H7QUQB0DB,I like it but there is room for improvement! The smell and the packaging need to be worked on..,"I love/like this powder I just wish it didn't have a scent to it..  I could do without it other than that it does what it's supposed to do. It covers wonderfully it's one of my favorites. I use this powder to set my concealer. The packaging could be better, It looks like if you were to drop it would brake the plastic container looks kind of cheap. I give it 5 Stars Regardless of Covergirls packaging!!!! ☺😊😀😁😉😇 My skin looks wonderful when I put it on."
R1XBU0BNP20F4J,I love it. Buy it,"It works! It works!! I love it. Buy it.<br />I was skeptical when I heard a well respected television personality mention Rapid Brow for eyebrows but decided the affordable cost was well worth the try. I am so glad I did. Your full eyebrows will frame your face and this does what it promises. Yes, I found a hair on my eye lid just as an other reviewer warned would happen but I also have tweezers so no problem: I am happy with my full eyebrows."
R2LQO7DPO0OGSG,"Great product, great customer service!",This vitamin c serum is clear and odorless and feels very silky on your skin.  It comes in a sealed container with a pump dispenser that is extremely nice and doesn't allow air or impurities to enter into the serum.  I did some research into the types of vitamin c it contains and found out they are very stable forms of vitamin c.  I also contacted the company several times with questions about their products and received very fast and courteous replies.
R17A3JABIPJGMW,Five Stars,It has blown me away
R2K3YJL59B705O,Product is excellent but very thick and difficult to get out of ...,Misleading advertising. It does not come with a pump (sole reason for purchasing this particular item). Product is excellent but very thick and difficult to get out of bottle through flip top.
R2V0U4WF37MR5X,cute yet too many chemicals,"It took 20 days to arrive from China which I think is not too long. I was really excited for it and it finally arrived. I was afraid it would arrive melted because its been 90-100 degrees here in California. It arrived perfect, no colors were melted what-so-ever. There are other reviews where the item is melted but mines came perfect as shown in the picture.<br /><br />The actual product comes in a cute black box that makes it look professional like make up. Anyways, on the box it comes inside of, there is a list of chemicals that are used, most of which are poisonous/deadly/cause cancer if the chemicals come into contact with humans in a daily basis so looks like I'll be throwing it away. I love make up but I won't be using any that are known to cause cancer."
R3MXO5I60UG044,Five Stars,"Love these, use them all the time."
R1ZC6I5AXB0N8T,"Very nice, but maybe a litte overpriced.","Really nice citrus/grapefruit smell--light and sweet.  Not too strong. You have to use a ton though because the smell does not last long at all.  I usually apply more around the middle of the day.  I went through the bottle pretty darn quickly, so kind of expensive."
RZH316Q0OWBFM,Five Stars,My wife prefers it over other conditioners and that is why we order it periodically!
R29KP0HKGENPOJ,wonderful product,"excellent quality product, I use it every day and I can say I have the skin of my face much clearer, the results are surprisingly fast, and acne scars have gone, regret not being able to have a product like this makes a couple of years ago, really amazing. I recommend it."
R1ZACZGZ4KE21N,Five Stars,great love it thanks---pt
R2YR10BR9AO73H,Wonderful item great for hot and cold therapy,"This is a wonderful product. It is soft to the touch, I love the satiny feel. You can warm it in the microwave and place it anywhere you need heat therapy. Or toss it in the freezer awhile and use it anywhere you need cold therapy. It conforms well to any part of your body. I do get migraines. They are awful. I can't handle lights, or sounds or movement when they hit. They can last a long time. So I have a prescription, but it takes time to work. I got one the other day and while I lay in the dark waiting for my pills to kick in I remembered I had this in the freezer, so I sent my son to get it and my peppermint oil and I put a drop of oil on each temple then placed this over my eyes. It made such a huge difference. The cooling from the pillow mingled with the healing powers of the peppermint EO and my meds finally kicking in and I was able to drift off to sleep and woke up with no migraine. Of course the prescription is the only thing that makes them really go away for me, but this helps me be more comfortable while I wait for it to pass. I cannot like this product any more than I already do.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."

R2Z61BFU672BEE,Product can be used on both wet and dry hair which I love because I don't shampoo my hair everyday,"Received order in 4 days!  Have used the product every day since receiving.  Product can be used on both wet and dry hair which I love because I don't shampoo my hair everyday.  Usage makes this product very versatile!  Ultrax Labs Hair Lush gives your hair INSTANT thickness and volume!  Doesn't weigh the hair down or make it feel dirty.  U.L.Hair Lush was AWESOME because it did not &#34;dry out&#34; my hair.  Nice, clean fragrance, too.  Will definitely purchase again; and would recommend this product for anyone with thin, lifeless and aging hair.  A must have!!!!!"
R16EU5CH0I2N6U,"Works nicely, but irritated my scalp.","I used this with 20 vol. developer, for my highlights.  They came out nicely, so this does work well.<br />However, it irritated my scalp, so I don't think I will be using it again.<br />I will probably use one of the Redken bleach mixes."

RJ42N9EHE42NO,Soooo soft!!!,"I put a hair mask on my hair last night, and had on washing my hair. I needed to wash the mask out. I put this microfiber towel on my head, and it was so comfortable that I completely forgot it was even there.<br /><br />Actually fell asleep with this on my head, and woke up with it still in place. And I'm not going to lie... I slept so good... Which is weird considering I had a towel on my head.<br /><br />But it's so soft, and so ridiculously comfortable that it's almost 830 in the morning and I still have it on. Not for any other reason then it's just so comfortable. And soft... OMG so soft. I can see me using this all the time because yes...<br /><br />I used to use one of those Terbi twist things, but I hated it. It was so tight around my head that I felt like my head was trying to be popped when I wore it. It was so annoying, but when my hair was really long I needed to put it in a towel for a good five minutes.  Since I have curly hair it's a process after I wash it, and process doesn't happen, I have really bad hair days. After a horrible between fiasco, I just went back to a regular towel, and eyes are so heavy that she's not even comfortable. This one is not heavy, is a very lightly, and again. It's ridiculously soft.<br /><br />There's nothing to hate about this, I feel like I need to have seven that way I can have one for every day of the week and never worry about not having one. I swear I'm not even being dramatic... It's that good.<br /><br />And it comes with a super cute travel bag! So if we travel I can take it with me and not worry about it moistness ruining anything else. And I'm not worried about this getting ruined itself because it's not going to mold, not that I plan on leaving and it's bag for too long.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is amazing and I love it.<br /><br />I received a discounted rate. I chose to do the review on my own."

R3JGQ10SVLRW8N,Very large and very heavy!,"I'm not sure if I just misread the details or if there just wasn't dimensions listed, but this nail polish display was MUCH, MUCH larger than I expected. Too large for what I wanted. However, it's very sturdy and looks beautiful. I'm giving it 4 stars because it's very, very heavy... to the point I'm a little afraid to mount it on the wall. I'm worried that you it will fall due to its weight and the fact that it only came with two screws to fasten it to the wall. I can easily replace those screws for heavy duty ones I'm sure, but for now it's just going to sit on the floor leaning against the wall. Overall, good product."

RTFSLHSW7SOC4,My 2nd GBS brush as good as the 1st.,"This brush performs as advertised.  It is luxurious, holds water well and creates an excellent lather.<br />The break-in time is short.  By the 2nd use, there was not a hint of odor (common with badger brushes).  By the third use the brush was in full bloom, the bristles soft and silky.<br />What I like best, when compared to other brushes is the density of the brush.  It has enough backbone to easily load the cream or soap from the bowl.  It performs as a silvertip should at about half the price of other silvertip badger brushes.<br />After a month of use, I have only lost a couple of bristles, which I consider normal."

R3OO69Q387G78R,Shiny hair - dries quickly,"I purchased this to use as a second hair dryer to keep at my boyfriend's place. I was looking for a reputable brand with good reviews, but also a low price. This met all of my qualifications. It is a great value for the price and it works just as I need it to. I love the cool air blast button that I can use to finish off my curls and cool myself down. The ions seem to leave a nice shine in my hair as well, and it dries quickly."

It has a neutral, earthy (non-commercial) smell and of course, it is oily. The KEY to using it for the 125% wonderful results I've had is to find the “dosage” that works for you. I pump a healthy drop into the palm of my hand, mix it with warm water, and spread/massage the mixture all over my face and neck. I’ve been using it for three+ weeks now and my skin has never been clearer!! It also feels incredibly supple, smooth, and healthy, more so than with any other product I've used. The only downside is that all the other, expensive products I’ve bought are destined to languish on the shelf now, because I will only be using this one for the foreseeable future."

R3UZ6D7R3RVQH5,Hard to clean,"I've been using this product for over a year now. I've used other Sonicare brushes in the past but wanted to try this one as it was 1) cheaper and 2) the heads looked sturdier. I've had problems with the metal pin getting loose and rendering the brush useless (when out of the warranty period) on other models. This one has its own problems that I find much more annoying. It's very difficult to clean. You have to get down inside of it frequently or nasty toothpaste gunk builds up. It builds up in the heads as well, but that's much harder to clean... and it can start to smell, well within the 3 months that a head should be good for. I wish I had just paid the extra and bought the model I've used in the past. Neither one is close to perfect but this one's problems are much more annoying day to day."
REQK9K4WJ6TDA,it goes on nicely without feeling greasy but probably not something I would ...,"Not what I expected.  Smell was just okay.  Although it is an oil, it goes on nicely without feeling greasy but probably not something I would order again.  Didn't really see where it made my tan glow or last any longer."
R1V8GS7W9K8H9L,SP-3141 replaced by SPR head assembly,"I purchased this product, Remington SP-3141 Replacement Rotary Heads and Cutters (orange packaging), for my R-4130 razor.  This is the razor that allows each individual shaver head to twist-open from the top, to remove the cutter blades for cleaning.<br /><br />The product I received was, Remington SPR Replacement Shaver Head (black packaging)…  [[ASIN:B003S6CVIC Remington SPRCDN Universal Rotary Replacement Shaver Head, Black]]  This is an entire head assembly and the 3 individual heads are not removable, but you can remove the cutter blades from the inside (with the head open).  My original head was all-black, but this new head is chrome (silver) on the top-half with black on the 3 rotary head retaining rings.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and they discovered that Remington has stopped making the SP-3141 and the SPR head is currently the only option they offer.  The SPR packaging says it works with the R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 series.<br /><br />PRO (SPR):<br />* Each cutter has 2 rings of blades instead of one for a quicker shave.<br /><br />CON (SPR):<br />* Does not come with a clear plastic cover for the head and the R-4130 cover does not fit.<br />* The head closes fine, but when you push the front release button, the head seems to be stuck and needs some force to open.  It doesn’t pop-open like the original head.<br /><br />See attached 4 photos for details of the Remington SPR shaver head."

I am using it to lighten darkening age spots on my skin and it is working well. Paraben free. The oil is so amazing that they back it 100 percent so you can buy knowing the company will stand behind their product. After washing my face, I use twice per day morning and evening. It is easy to use and absorbs quickly. No residue left leaving you uncomfortable and greasy."

R1AVZQFMVGCTAZ,Smooth and Silky!,The first and best part is the smell which is very nice and lasts a long time too. This is a stay in your hair kind of conditioner like feeling that lasts all day. I used it on my fine hair and it worked great. My wife's course hair lightened up a bit and she liked it very much. We have been using Dove products for years and this is a winner like most of their products.<br /><br />Decent price-Dove does not disappoint!

R2LJWF5S4VGAVW,"Hoped it would work miracles like people said, but just a disappointment","Did make my thick and extremely curly hair a little smoother. Not worth the effort of the process in my opinion. And the worst part is the smell. Any time heat is applied to your hair after you've applied this (blow dry, straighten, even showering in hot water) this strong, chemical smell takes over! And it lasts for at least a month. My husband even commented on it just being in the same room as me."

R3UVQPNFNFFQDQ,Awesome! But mainly for longer eyebrows.,"I'm giving five stars, though there is one little bummer. It's very minor, so I figure I'll say that first. These are for long eyebrows. Or probably average. I have short eyebrows, and found only three stencils that are the length of filling in my eyebrows in a way that would look natural for me. But I know my eyebrows are not on &#34;fleek,&#34; lol. So, it's probably perfectly fine.<br />They are all different, and 24 count. I'll admit it took me a while to figure out why some stencils were bigger than others, and that is because you can use the bottom curve over your eyebrow to fill in better without going &#34;out of bounds.&#34; Overall, I'm really pleased. They're a pretty firm, flexible plastic, easy to hold against the browbone without it moving around, but also easy to clean with a wipe. It also came here earlier than expected. c:"

RXFN3BT88CHBB,Not a close shave,Poor quality. Not a close shave at all. My husband didn't care for having to shave again with blade razor after using this. So he gave it to our teenage son to use and even he said it wasn't a good shave.
R3G6I2E8JWWWMN,Progress in 3 days.,"Been using for 3 days and totally feel a difference in the trouble areas of elbows, knees, and heels.<br /><br />Only have an issue trying to do this when my body is not damp since I work out just before my shower.

R9DW0L86DUFD0,Rip-off! $10.59 for less than an ounce of product,"I have to echo the other reviews here. This is clearly marked 'Sample. Not for resale'.<br /><br />BUT not only is it tiny and super-expensive, even the gross weight of the whole full bottle does not come to the advertised 2 ounces. The whole thing weighs less than 1.4 ounces. The nett weight of the liquid inside is about equal to half of that, so in terms of the product itself, you're probably getting considerably less than 1 ounce. I've weighed this using both analog and digital scales.<br /><br />I wish I'd read the reviews here before buying. Clearly this seller pays no attention to the reviews here, dating back to June 2013.<br /><br />And I don't care how good this stuff is. I'd rather shave my head than put money in these guys pockets again."
R3HFI5ABOKW0D1,I'm not sure if it was a bad batch or what but it was quite repulsive,"I used to wear this cologne when I was a teen, but when I received this one it had a very strong alcohol smell. I'm not sure if it was a bad batch or what but it was quite repulsive."
R36U2HFLKFZ2DO,Happy Cherry Blooms customer.,"I've been looking for a solution to thin, short eyelashes for a long time.  I've tried lots and lots of mascaras and several of the liquid growth products that are on the market.  The only thing I really liked the look of was individual eyelash extensions but they didn't last long enough and having them redone would have cost a small fortune over time!  I'd about given up when I came across this product quite accidently.  It is easy to apply although it adds a few minutes to my daily morning routine and with a little practice, I got better and faster with the application.  I wear contacts and have to be a little more careful about not letting the fibers get into my eyes  I love the look although no one mentioned any noticeable difference except one friend that I told about it.  But I noticed and I felt better.  I would definitely buy again."
R2AYU4PC18H49R,Five Stars,Great color
R1D83FZKR7U991,Curly or course,"My hair is not really curly but it is coarse. This Dove product helps keep it softer. Now, nothing is going to make my hair completely soft, but this has certainly made it more manageable.<br />It is thick and can be used in wet or dry hair from the roots to the end and then you can style.<br /><br />The sides of my long hair tend to stick out and this helps keep control of that loose fuzz that sticks out around my ears.<br />The fragrance is not bad and add to that Dove's usual reasonable cost in their hair products which makes this is decent hair product."

RK8HX1Z2FX02O,Brilliant HD whitening gel - exceptional,"I've used many teeth whitening products over the years and most produce good results so when I had the opportunity to purchase this brand of teeth whitening at a reduced price so I could try it and then give my honest opinion of this product I wasn't expecting anything different than other brands. I was pleasantly surprised, the trays that you put the whitening liquid in are first warmed in hot water and then put in the mouth to form around your teeth for a good tight fit. That was very easy to do and I liked that they were essentially made for my bottom and upper teeth.<br />The whitening gel didn't burn my gums or irritate my mouth at all and that was nice because I assumed to have white teeth you had to have some amount of irritation of the gums. The gel didn't run all over the place nor did I have to sit with a cloth by my mouth and keep wiping up all the gel that would run out of my mouth which I've experienced with every other brand.<br />After you're done with the whitening gel there is also a small tube of blue gel that is a remineralizing treatment for your teeth. That's also a first for me and I was impressed with that. After only 3 treatments and leaving the trays in my mouth for only 6 minutes each time I had a noticeable improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. I'm pretty happy with Brilliant HD whitening kit and would buy again."

I don't know yet whether it'll actually prevent any wrinkles, but I do know that I have never had a cream that made my face feel so nice and smooth after use.  It feels wonderful rubbing this in at night, and I think it helps me to relax a bit, too.  I also have noticed that I have far less redness on my face when I get acne; I tried a facial product (a cleanser) about a week ago that irritated my skin and I found that this night cream soothed the irritation very well and took the redness away.  I also appreciate the way the container is designed:  you don't have drips or any wasted product; you just get a small, usable amount out at a time.<br /><br />I am sensitive to strong-smelling products, greasy products, and anything that is too thick on the face -- this night cream has very little scent to it and has a flawless texture.  It has really helped make my face softer and more comfortable, without requiring me to expel too much effort (I don't like to spend hours messing with my face).<br /><br />I also need to say a word about the seller:  I was very impressed that the seller messaged me immediately after the purchase with advice as to how to best use the product.  I felt that the concern for the customer spoke volumes; I'll definitely buy this cream again in future (although it won't be anytime too soon because it's big enough to last quite a while)."

RZB9E8KDYCBEO,"Creamy, Glide-On Shadows (5- Stars)","These eye shadow sticks glide on color and blend easily to give a crease-free look throughout the day or evening.  They have a shimmer to them but not too much -- I like shimmer without making it look like I'm trying to imitate a teenager.  The sticks advance by twisting, and they are longer than I expected, which is great since I now know they will last for a long time.  The colors on the product page, as seen on my iMac, don't quite match the reality, sometimes for the best and sometimes not.  The Topaz is bright blue -- and I mean BRIGHT -- but the Yellow is more toned down and more light gold than yellow than it appears in the photo.  The Amethyst is a dark, smoky purple.  The Emerald looks more like a teal.  Marble Elegant is a rosy beige.  I really like all colors but the Topaz, which is just too bright for my tastes.<br /><br />A sampling of different colors is a great way to change up your look and to match what you're wearing.  They are especially good for someone who is still experimenting to find out which colors bring out the best in her eyes.  With colors that range from dark to light, you can use a mixture of colors for highlighting.  Because these eyeshadows blend so easily, they make applying shadow a breeze.  Note:  I received free samples for test and review.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"

R277TFXBV62RL6,Great!!,Great experience! Can't wait to order from them again.<br />Thanks
R1A9A9JC98V0IJ,Perhaps not great for sensitive skin,"After much deliberation I bought this My Beauty Diary product. I have somewhat sensitive, acne-prone skin and am very careful with what I put on my skin. After reading the reviews Id thought I'd give it a try. I put on the mask, and after a somewhat anti-climatic gooey 10 mins, I took the mask off. The serum from the mask sort of sit on my skin and didn't fully absorb like I had expected. And, to add insult to injury, the next day I woke up with two cysts on my right cheek. It's important to note - for those with teenage, acne-prone, or sensitive skin - that the cysts could have been from something else, but I thought it crucial to include it just in case you buy this and it does the same to your skin (especially if it's the night before a big event like a prom or wedding).<br />Ultimately, a quick fix for normal skin, but not the best choice for sensitive, teenage, or acne-prone skin."
R1TVG4MU9X7F1X,Love it!!,Love love love this! My sister gave it to me for Easter and I have been hooked ever since. This goes on really nice and light and soaks right in. No greasy feel at all. And I think my face looks really good these days- especially since I'm getting up there in age! (53).  Also love that the company will email you just one time to see if you like it and if you have any feed back for them. They don't keep bugging you which is a plus. I would highly recommend this product!

R1VSU3LDVGHV9P,not horrible. I had origionally purchased this product in hopes ...,"The Wonder Pore Deep Foaming Cleanser is an okay cleanser. Not spectacular, not horrible.<br /><br />I had origionally purchased this product in hopes of having a slightly stronger cleanser to use in the evenings than just the Wonder Pore Whipping Foaming Cleanser. However, after purchasing, I realized that this wash is actually not PH balanced, which was my main reason for purchasing the product.<br /><br />That being said, this product isn't bad. It has little microbeads that help exfoliate gently and would be great for combo-oily sensitive skin as the beads are not rough at all.<br /><br />The smell is very different from the Whipping Foam. Instead of having a &#34;tootie fruity&#34; type scent, this one reminded me more of peppermint. It also leaves a very cooling sensation on the skin.<br /><br />All in all, this is a decent product and might even be a great product for someone who enjoys high alkaline based foaming cleansers. I may pass this one on to my boyfriend and see if he enjoys it."

But I've found this 6 blade razor performs better than anything I've used before.  The replacement blades [[ASIN:B012CD1GU0 Remington Men's Six Blade System Cartridge Refills]] are also cheaper than the other big brands that make razors. The handle does seem a little lighter weight than the gillette that I used to use, but that doesn't really matter to me. The blades are sharp, don't clog easily and this provides a great shave."

It hurts a little at first, but you get used to it and it's definitely worth it.<br />Other pros: easy to clean (the ends screw off) and hasn't rusted at all after 4-5 months of consistent use.<br />I also tried it on my boyfriend and it plucked even the thickets hairs out!"
R3P1ZMRFZHFZKF,Absolutely Beautiful,"I love this tiara. It is absolutely beautiful. I have to say that I was very surprised at the weight of it. It isn't thin or made of cheap quality. I bought this for my granddaughter, who will be 4 right after Christmas, for a Christmas present. I had it on the counter and my son walked in with her without me knowing and she accidentally seen it and got so excited. I had to give it to her, and she was so beautiful in it. It is very sparkly and shinny. She looks like a little princes in it."

RCR8XBD7TCOXT,I was disappointed that it doesn't seem to be very highly pigmented,I've worn Clinique brown cake eyeliner for 30-some years.  I thought I'd try something new and less expensive.  I was disappointed that it doesn't seem to be very highly pigmented.  The color when applied is more beige than brown.  I use it on days when I'm just knocking around the house.
RPZ6GSBLFX2Z4,A great mirror for a very good price (when I bought it)!,"I ordered this item to replace an IKEA mirror (also very good) of similar design but less magnification.  This mirror is 7X and my IKEA mirror was, I believe, 3X.  This mirror is well made, looks great, and works as described.  My wife is very happy that it helps her see a lot better with its 7X magnification.  Happily, the mirror's installation holes lined up with the holes for the IKEA mirror that I replaced, so all is good.  The mirror is also bigger than the IKEA mirror, which is also a plus.  The only reason that I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the weight.  This mirror is a lot heftier than the mirror I replaced, so I am hoping that the old anchors (which were not small anchors) will hold this for the long term.  And, just to be clear, this mirror is not too heavy, it is just heavier than the previous mirror due to its larger size and solid construction."

R4857BBTGVOPE,wonderful,this is the best oil for my skin. I have very dry skin and I use it a few times a day
R1856F5I57EFD,B.E.A.U-tiful,"I am an avid makeup wearer and an addict of Too Faced eyeshadow palettes for many reasons. I love that they come in this super cute little metal compact that is magnetic. There is a little instruction booklet that is fastened in front of the mirror that you can remove and get some assistance on deciding how you want to wear your eye makeup that day!<br />The pigmentation of these shadows is great and they last all day for me (roughly 12 hours). I have been wearing makeup for.. quite awhile and would always suggest using an eyeshadow primer no matter what brand or quality of eyeshadow you're using. There are several different price points of primers so try some out and see which works best for you!<br />I like to apply these with a double ended shadow brush so I can get it on point and then use the other side to blend it in to a more natural look. The colors remind me a lot of my Urban Decay Naked palette (which I also love), but this is a little cheaper and may be a better option for some people that can't afford the Naked collection. I have both, but reach for this one a little more often since they are similar and it's cheaper (I want my Naked to last longer since it cost me more).<br />Overall, this palette is bomb, just like all other Too Faced palettes. The shadows all glide on super smooth like butter and look gorgeous all day!"

Included a .22fl oz of the color &#34;nude reflection&#34; and a .07oz of &#34;candid cider&#34;. I was happy to recieved two tubes of gloss, but I was wishing the larger tube was the color that I ordered. I feel this should be advertised the way that it arrives.Not sure I would have purchased a .07 fl oz of the Candid Cider. The site starts .22 fl oz. Also, I'm not sure where this item was stored...but the packing has a very strong oder to it and the tubes of color do a little too. The gloss itself smells fine."
R1EDYE6QCUQ0EK,Fantastic quality!,"This was was inexpensive and fantastic quality. VERY soft.  I reviewed a bunch of curly wigs for a Slash costume, even though this hair was longer, the other wigs didn't seem to hold up in reviews, but everyone was happy with this one.  Not  only was i very happy with it, but my 20 girlfriends at the same dress up party LOVED the wig and tried it on and were all very impressed with how soft it was, what good quality it was.  It came neatly packaged and wrapped to avoid getting mussed up.  Looks just like the photo."

R3BYEG0ZFTPPLQ,Lovely case and great brushes,"I wear makeup daily so I was pretty excited to give this set a try.  I mainly just accentuate my features.  I don't cake on my makeup and brushes and sponges can make a world of difference when it comes to applying makeup properly.  I have never had a great quality set of brushes.  Most of mine have been freebies that come with expensive makeup in department stores.  They have worked well but I was quite limited and had to get creative when trying to use a brush to do something it wasn't meant for.  These brushes will be such a time saver.<br /><br />The brushes are a mix of synthetic and real hair attached to a wood handle with the Essencell  logo on the handle.  They came individually wrapped in plastic and the larger ones have a reusable plastic sleeve for the brush heads.  They were each in a pocket inside the very nice case that has a magentic closure.  The case was wrapped and placed inside a nice cardboard Essencell box.<br /><br />I immediately washed them as instructed to do so.  I focused on the large brushes to work out a lot of the loose hairs, which wasn't that bad.  When I used them they left hardly any hairs behind and I expect that to lessen with use as the loose hairs work themselves out.  The brushes picked up a good amount of makeup and applied it smoothly to my face.  The sponges made it easy to blend and were comfortable to hold in my hand.<br /><br />Having these brushes will save a lot of time for me since I don't have to get creative using a brush for something it's not made for and I don't have to keep going over places.  They also feel good in my hands.<br /><br />I received a slight discount on this set in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  5 stars are never guaranteed but these brushes do exactly as they're suppose to do and I love them.  They will be getting used daily!"
RMLQC94AQ12O5,Three Stars,I will use it as it is difficult to find products for grey & silver hair.
R13WB94HE0GXD9,"So, so","Its ok it feels good but I followed directions and it has not done what it promised.  It said to mix with regular face cream and brown spots would start to diminish, well I don't see it at least not yet and it has been at least a few weeks or more."

R33UA93TUUSE8B,Lavender,Love the product. It arrived Monday afternoon.
R3628GHTTVPKRL,Dissapointing,"This is nothing more than a lip gloss that doesn't last. I wanted a universal topcoat that I can put on and last all day to keep my color. Revlon has an amazing topcoat as a half lipstick half topcoat that lasts a good 6hrs or so, and I just wanted the topcoat part.  All this is unfortunately is lip gloss. Goes on shiny, and doesn't last more than an hour. Less if you eat, lick your lips, kiss anyone, etc. You're better off purchasing a regular lip gloss"
R1CGSU6JI9E3KM,excellent product!,Excellent product!  Fast delivery!
R1WTK6EMAEVAKA,Repeat customer for life!,This is the 4th or 5th time I've repurchased this product. I used to get mild back breakouts so I started using it after my gym sessions where my skin ends up coming in contact with mats and equipment other people frequently use and I have been clear ever since. The product itself is pretty watery but a little goes a long way. I use with my regular puff when showering and it lathers extremely well. I bought a mini travel bottle as well and just refill it from this bottle. I also bought the bar soap version as well and keep it by the sink. Awesome products!
RMLFC2WB7MHN2,Five Stars,AAA
R10URUA1V8L1CZ,"Less Frizz, More Softness",My hair has been super soft since using this. I use it once a week in combination with the Pantene Damage Detox Shampoo and Conditioner. My hair also seems to be handling the summer humidity with significantly less frizz.
R1XWV6VRDZH7HC,Dr suggested,"Bought this on suggestion of my doctor for back and hip pain. Works amazingly. It does everything he was doing for me in office. Make sure you use it properly and get a doctors help the first time. My sacrum centered pain, hips and back pain are almost all fixed when using this. I need to start using it when I'm not in pain to build up the benefits."

I do see a difference in the texture of my skin when I don't use it so it is helping my skin.  However, Olay has discontinued making it.  I got this searching in Amazon but I can't find it at any store so I'm not sure if I want to keep ordering it since the container is so small and I have to find something else to replace it because it is no longer made by Olay."
R37HHCFZ7NSZFB,Definitely not worth it. Regular concealer applied after normal moisturizer stays much better!,"I don't notice any brightening. And this is a two step process. Time consuming compared to applying regular concealer. You have to apply the moisturizer, the brightener and wait a long time for it to dry then gently pat on concealer because if not it is very runny. It doesn't cover well and doesn't stay on. Do not recommend."
R33N5IOHJSNOIG,Worth the money,"I had hair loss around the edges due to tight braids.  I have tried the spray, the grease - they did nothing and cost a lot!  Finally I can see that my hair line is coming back.  Well worth the cost."
R1PQ5WC807D188,Love this stuff - the best!,Love this stuff!  It is so creamy that I use morning and night.  I love the little spoon/spatula in it's little case.  This tub will last me a very long time and I am using 2x a day.  Will definitely include this as part of my morning / evening routine.  My lips are so soft after just one use!

RFUJRQRZ02G7R,Color not as Expected,"I bought this because it was discounted. From the description photo, you can tell that the color in the case is more blue than the swatch shown above it, which is more pink. The actual color is that in the case."
RQEM4BMNOUNVS,Nice product but a little on the expensive side,"I like this product, go on very smooth and smells great. I use a pump in the morning and a pump at night and I am already running out it and it's only been close to 2 weeks.  I haven't really noticed any difference in my skin yet but I like the fact this is not irritating or cause any redness.  Does. It sting either.<br /><br />I like the product over all but wish the size was bigger and more affordable. I would buy again if it was cheaper."
R3OIUDDHBCKPQL,"Try it, it works!",I have only been using this product for a few weeks but I see a difference in the way my skin looks and feels. I will definitely purchase this product again. I have had really good luck with all the Body Merry products.
R1OF7CO4KJB64U,Waste of money,"The first time I'm using it, I noticed something black coming off on my foot. I was about to really freak out when I realized that it was the surface of the scrub that was disintegrating. It literally dissolved and rubbed off completely while I'm still using it on one foot, there was nothing left on it to use on my other foot. Then instead of making my foot feel smooth, it actually made it more rough. I regularly use a similar type wand in the shower at least once or twice a week, and this was supposed to be a replacement, so there was no reason for it to dissolve from use, except that it was of mediocre quality.  I had to go back to my old wand (luckily, I hadn't thrown it away before I got this). Then, the next day, it started peeling away from the plastic. This is not worth the few dollars it costs. Its a waste of money. Get something else."

R2592X7CCJW18Z,I thought I loved Night Rider from Kevin Murphy,"Now that my hair is in the awkward stage of &#34;just beyond short&#34; and &#34;not yet long enough where I don't have to bother styling it&#34;, I needed something to work some magic into my straight, thick Asian hair.  I thought I loved Night Rider from Kevin Murphy.. it turns out I LOVE this paste even more.  Instead of using a comb, I blow dry and then use this paste as I run my fingers through my hair.  Voila, my hair looks styled.  A little hairspray and I'm out the door.  A few reviewers described it accurately as &#34;It's more of a liquid type of paste, completely different than &#34;Kevin Murphy Night Rider Matte. It holds, gives the hair body, puts the hair in place but is not stiff or greasy.&#34;  Buying this again."

R2CM9GC0IHTPFI,Epique Blemish and Blackhead Extractor Kit,"If you want to give yourself a professional facial at home, then you need to do so in style with the Epique Blemish and Blackhead Extractor. It helps get rid of the blemish core, which is key to getting rid of the blemish. You cannot do that with your hands as easily, and if you do then you usually end up getting the blemish extra infected, too strained or too bloody. A pro extractor does the job right the first time and every time. Keep them clean by using soap and water and then rubbing alcohol. Make sure to not use too much pressure so as not to cause a rupture around the skin. Use gentle pressure to get the blemish and use steam or a hot washcloth first to soften the blemish first."
R20FUISY3M2C5U,In principle a very good product. It does retain a nice temperature for ...,In principle a very good product. It does retain a nice temperature for about 8 minutes and has been beneficial to me. However the lid side of the holder is very flimsy and shreds easily. Also overpriced for what you get.
R118MPQJS07NDU,"Solid performer, nurtures older hair","I have old hair....very long, straight and mostly grey/ white. I look for shampoo that can cleanse and moisturizer while not stripping the ends dry. This shampoo does a decent job; it lathers well and rinses out clear, leaving my hair soft and manageable. The scent is mild and fresh. I'd say this is in second place after Tresemme Youth Boost which does a slightly better job. I do like it and think it helps me maintain healthy hair without flyaways and breakage."
R39FNJB0PXXMJC,"Runs wide, Too hard",Runs a little wide and hard as a rock. You'll need another insole on top. Sending back. Too wide for all my shoes.

RV10W9XJ725VU,Love Love Love !,"I am super pleased with you'll product . First of all it came super fast, which is a super +A. *Not to mention I just ordered the product this Thursday and it's here on Sunday already ! I can't wait to fill it up with my polishes and other nail equipment. The packaging was great and wrapped very tight. Lol I actually had to pull very hard to rip the plastic. It's true to its color and the quality of the material superb .  A+ for that. It's truelly worth the price. The was inside one of the nail slots ! Basically everything was intacted !  However in the yellow little envelope it says they give you a free gift, but I seen no free gift at all in the box. Maybe it's in the package box. I'll look again though. I'm totally losted about that part or maybe I have to go on the website. Idk I'm not sure . Overall, great product . I'm actually looking into buying the make-up box as well .  Down below I have posted some pictures"
R2F9JM0XUO2IBL,Excellent gift!,"This is an excellent array of ten makeup brushes that are beautifully presented in a pleather wrap that ties closed to give it a fashionable high-end look. There is a very slight drawback that I must mention in all honesty -- the set needs to be aired out because of the lingering smell of the pleather. However, once I unrolled it, the smell dissipated in half an hour or so. Each brush is encased in a clear wrap to preserve the integrity of their intended shape. My experience indicated little or no shedding. The coloration is delightful, so this set would make a very nice gift. I received a sample set in exchange for an honest review, and I am very well pleased with the quality and design. I would certainly give this set to a friend or family member. Quality is higher than the price suggests!"

R221DY14H1OF2U,The best flat iron on the market!!,Wow!!!!! I have owned many flat irons in my life and this one is by far the best of them all!!!! Forget Chi and Baby Bliss this is the way to go. It heats to 400 in literally five seconds. It takes me half the time to straighten my hair than it normally does. My hair is so frizzy in the spring and summer but with this it stays smooth all day! It's worth every penny if you straighten your hair several times a week. I'm not sure how I ever lived without it!!! My hair stylist used a very expensive $400 straightner and when she tried this she was amazed and immediately ordered one for herself. I can't rave about it enough!!!
R37T86P2T6401J,Amazing products,"I started using your products when I asked my stylist what I should be using on my hair. My only requirements were: 1.  I need a pump because I have complex regional pain syndrome, 2.  I need something that requires little effort for the same reason, and 3.  I need something that is inexpensive as I'm now on SSD. Your products are awesome!!!!!  My hair shines, is silky smooth and is so easy to comb through. I get so many compliments. Thank you so much!!"

Thought I was getting the one I usually order, but this was a good thing as I love the Amara Organics Vit. C Serum much better than the other product I was using.  This product is thinner and applies much easier, plus it will last longer as I don't use as much on each application.  It dries quickly and doesn't have a mask like feel once dried."

R1GEVKQ5PKFLW2,I'm running out of patience - and looking for an alternative.,"Unless they figure how to improve this product so it doesn't leak when I travel I'm moving on to another product.

RO9BTIV78JUTJ,Five Stars,Excellent product.. Leaves hair soft!
R1RUUFQXJHFZ9C,Great lather and scent,"I started using this soap years ago. The bars are large, last much longer than the average bar of soap, and it really lathers up, even in hard water. The verbena scent is pleasant and not sicklingly sweet.<br />If you have small children,  you may want to cut the bars in half so little hands can handle them easier."
R3O46WYE4OAYSM,"Lipstisk that looks Polished, not Overdone","If you like an opaque glossy look for your lips, this lipstick is for you. I frequently wear Dior Addict Lipstick for a casual, finished look. It feels smooth; not sticky, not too creamy. It's not overly glossy and the colors are not too deep. Hypnotic Plum goes on with a glossy hint of plum. It has enough color and sheen to make me look put together, but not like I tried. The case is gorgeous. The lipstick has a the &#34;CD&#34; in a contrasting color going all the way through the bullet; it's not merely embossed. I love this lipstick! It brightens my smile."

I was actually looking to buy some of these products individually and luckily was able to find them all conveniently packaged together :) lucky me. Here are some individual reviews of the products:<br /><br />All about the eyes cream: This product has always worked well for me i love both the orange and the night repair one for keeping my under eyes moisturized. Although they do not eliminate dark circles or bags completed (what product really does nowadays?) I've definitely noticed a significant reduction after continual use and ran out of my previous products.<br /><br />The joint mascara and lipstick is a must have in my purse!!! I love it for on the go touch ups and the lipstick is a beautiful shade that matches the tone of my natural lip color.<br /><br />I also adore the make up remover, I use it before bed and my eyeliner comes right off! I use the foam cleanser especially for when I have to go on vacations its much easier to pack than my normal facial cleanser.<br /><br />Overall, this product was totally worth the near $17 I paid for it!"

My friend bought one similar to this for $60, and hers only has two arms, not the accordion-like extension this has.  It is very compact when fully closed and easy to get out-of-the-way.  My husband mounted it behind the bathroom door and it's very easy to see from the vanity mirror.  Also easy to just turn and use it on the magnification side when applying eye makeup.  Since the mirror swivels, I can get it at an angle where it catches the light well."

While it is a &#34;set,&#34; it isn't a &#34;gift set.&#34;  There is no packaging and the items are tossed loose in a padded envelope. You could always buy a gift bag and some ribbon to make it into a gift set, if you are so inclined.<br /><br />As far as the products go...<br /><br />1. Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser: I LOVE this face wash.  I have been using it for 1-2 years and have it on Subscribe & Save on Amazon since the local drugstores' prices are $3+ more a tube.  It truly is like washing your face with cream.  It is super moisturizing and I don't have dry skin at bedtime since using this.  Less dry skin means less chance of wrinkles.<br />2. Coconut Foot Cream: Nicely scented but definitely not a &#34;cream.&#34;  It is more like a Vaseline texture.  I don't like that consistency but if you do, it is quite hydrating.<br />3. Deep Cleansing Cream:  It is a fine face wash but a bit more drying than the Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser.  I will be sticking with my favorite but this may be good for younger teen faces that are a constantly oily.<br />4. Milk and Honey Body Lotion:  I really enjoy the scent of this one and the lotion goes a long way.  I will be re-purchasing to use on my arms and legs before bed.  The scent is perfect to snuggle up to.<br />5. Shea Butter Hand Repair Cream: I really like the consistency and the level of moisture but am not a fan of the smell.  I won’t be purchasing this in a larger size unless they have another scent.<br />6. Intense Hydration Day Lotion: Very thick and a little goes a long way with this product too. I actually like this in a unique way.  The texture feels different than most lotions I've tried and I enjoy the difference... maybe because it is novel?  So far, I have not had any breakouts from this and will update if I do."
RW8EJWVQ0NES2,Four Stars,Great brush set at a great value
R39C1NV0RIDU1G,Four Stars,I love it.
R1WH84E5F5H2OP,It worked!,"My six year old has been bugging me for straight hair. I had gotten it flatironed in the salon and it had poofed before we even made it home so I didn't want to waste time and more money for the same result. I found this and thought I'd give it a try. The first time I used it I doubted it would work, it was a little hard to comb through and didn't straighten as easy as I thought it should have. I was surprised a week later when it was still straight! The first time I washed it, with the included shampoo and conditioner, it straightened easier. It has stayed straight and there are no more fights about her wanting straight hair. I am impressed for the price that it actually delivered!"
R3OCJ3WEEJLWUP,Maybelline fail,"you really have to shake the heck out of the product the first time or else it will come out runny. As soon as you hit the pump to release, it instantly came out and for me, even when I only held it down for one quick squirt, a lot came out. Not only that but the sunscreen basically makes up the scent of the entire foundation. Another thing is it &#34;Sizzles&#34; as soon as you squirt it.<br />Pros:<br />I will give props that this had a pump, as most foundations don't<br /><br />Cons:<br />Entire scent is sunscreen<br />Foams/Sizzles on skin instantly after being pumped<br />Goes on with a gross feeling of either oily or wet<br /><br />Ladies, give this product the cold shoulder and try another foundation."

R1S7E4R36HC12U,It works amazing,"This product is magic, as a teenager I had problems with acne on my face and so far I was ashamed, I decided to buy this product to remove my acne, miraculously this product took effect after a short time of use, It took off much of my red spots on my result of the acne"
R379DM3D2SVGCL,Love it!,Works as promised for age spots and bumps! Great product!
R3OG8YGM39NSPH,Best one,"Good product, committed service from the seller. I am fully satisfied."
R3B9KTNC05D0EM,Leaves an oily film on my skin,I bought this in the store and was so excited to try it when I got home - the jar was so overfilled with oil and it was hard to use. It smelled nice and did leave my skin soft but it also left a kind of oily film. I've been using a bar soap after I use this to kind of get some of the oil off my skin before I get out of the shower.
R27LA5NKW584N8,Five Stars,This stuff is amazing. It is cheap and it works like a charm. It also has a wonderful smell
R37CW9ZUIL14JP,Great clipper attachments.,The attachments arrived quickly and as described.  They fit the clippers perfectly. I am very pleased with the product and service I received.  I would definitely use Beauty Exchange LLC again.

R2OSZJL66X2T2F,Another Shu Uemura winner!,"I’ve tried four of the Shu Uemura masques.  All of the masques add a nice shine:<br />Moisture Velvet<br />Color Treated<br />Shusu Sleek<br />Ultimate Remedy<br /><br />I began mostly seeking “softness.”  Moisture Velvet has a really nice smell, and adds a feeling of softness.  Color Treated smells really nicely of rose, and while adding some softness, it isn't designed for what I seek, so I moved on.  Ultimate Remedy smells like the best designer perfume, and the scent lasts at least a week without washing.  It adds a feeling of being fortified but at the sacrifice of some softness.  Shusu Sleek has the least enticing scent in the jar but fortunately for me, I can barely smell it after treatment on dry hair. The scent is very peppery and masculine which is why I suppose they refer to this collection as unisex.  Shusu Sleek adds both softness and sleekness that results in “touchability.”  It also leaves the hair amazingly light.  I realized that enticing touchability was what I had been seeking all along, not just softness.  Problem is most products promising touchability lead to drier hair in the long run.  So for now I will stick with Shusu Sleek as my masque of choice, and wait to see what the long term effects are.<br /><br />I hope this review helps others trying to find which masque might work best for them."
R2VDWSL2BB8B2E,Nairobi Recovery,Works well with the  Nairobi Recovery  Salp treatment serum
R2XK2IFWN4G06V,Good,"Good and as advertised....it does not seem as close as the Wahl 4000 I had but when you get a new razor,they always fell different"
R2SU4UQ9LAP5XM,"excellent product, great price","Product arrived as depicted.  The heads functioned as well as the brand name Sonicare heads that I previously used.  After 2 weeks of use, my toothbrush head would not remain seated on the Sonicare unit.  I contacted the company by email regarding the problem,  and I was promptly sent a replacement head.  Neither my wife nor I have have had any further problem with the heads, which function perfectly.<br /><br />So in summary, excellent product, great price, and prompt service from Sonimart (if the need should arise).  Five Stars *****"
ROC8IUT1L38KT,Great value!,This is a great price for this lipstick that I buy typically at the Clinique counter. There's no box for packaging which is fine by me. A great value.

R1PHAHSXED92OX,It has worked miracles for me.,What can I say about this cleanser. It has changed my life. I have been using it for years and don't see myself stopping anytime soon. I use it twice a day. If I don't use it for a day or two I can really tell a difference. I would recommend this to anyone at any age.
R3CVU1NFDFRZKL,Love it!,"Hard to find shade- excellent, new condition. Not dried out or opened. Thank you- I love this shade and can't find an exact match in any other brand!"
R23J8HSJXA798E,Good Stuff,"This is great stuff because it works.  The product smells nice, the skin absorbs the oil & cream, one receives a good amount for the price & the pump makes it convenient & fun.  Coconut cream works well with sensitive skin.  For my old feet, using the large tool for scraping callouses & using this cream has turned my feet into smooth little pillows."
ROUL6OHUINS82,They are amazing! You can feel it cleaning your face even ...,"I will be buying these cleansing cloths again!  They are amazing!  You can feel it cleaning your face even without any soap or cleaner.  It cleans thoroughly without being overly rough on your skin.  Rinse well, squeeze it out, hang it up to dry and use it again next time.  A must have for any beauty care regime.  I also used it once with oil cleansing, and it worked perfectly.  The repair and protect cream is a different story.  I don't have anything terrible to say about it.  I smells really good, probably from the sandalwood extract.  It feels good on my face.  Sinks in fairly quickly.  I haven't seen any major benefits from it yet, but I've only used it 3 times so far.  The jury is out on whether it is a product I will want to keep around.  The only thing negative I have to say about the cream is it made my hands itch, pretty severely.  My face never itched, but the third time I put it on, I didn't wash my hands off immediately after putting it on my face.  Within a few minutes, my hands were on fire!  Even after washing them it itched.  I even did dishes to try to stop the itching!  I will wear gloves or wash quickly next time.  I did research all of the ingredients and feel pretty comfortable with them, so I'm not sure what caused the reaction.  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."

R31FGVMA8I7ULX,Great nail clippers for toe nails,"These are a great pair of nail clippers, especially for your toes. The straight edge is perfect for cutting big toes. All mine have been rounded and I've gotten ingrown toenails from them not being cut straight across. I hope this pair will correct that. These are nice and sharp and cut easily. I received this item at a discount in return for an honest review."
RGQ5NVD2KI2MP,Not what it used to be!,"Ouch! So sunburned! I am incredibly disappointed in this product. I was a believer in burnout in its early days - developed at the university in my hometown, recommended by our local dermatologist for us little junior lifeguard sunworshippers. I bought this many years later, but was a little wary having read the reviews. I bought three anyway. My husband and I had a weekend getaway and used an entire tube in one beach day (to give you an idea of how much we reapply... We are no sunscreen rookies... And a couple haoles...) we were burnt to a crisp from less than 3 hours in the sun with reapplication! To boot, the sunscreen is super thick and leaves you looking purple. On the market again for an eco friendly non toxic screen to protect us."
R25O6ZLVHE652G,best brand for nail stamping!,"This plate is soo cute! Got alot of compliments on my nails and other designs I ordered from this seller.

R1GAL7L7OUYU8H,Average performance at best,"This product seems like an average mousse with a medium hold at best. It does add some volume and bounce to the curl but I don't like the tacky feel it leaves behind. The hold isn't strong neither. By the second half of the day, the curl lost its definition and looked lifeless, I tried sprinkling water on the hair in an attempt to style and restore its definition but it didn't work. I felt my hair weighed down and tacky by the end of the day. I couldn't wait to wash off that tacky feel."
R1ROA2A95VL356,Five Stars,Excellent! I`m so happy.
R318PV8XCKBZOX,Great for organization and getting the most out of your collection.,"I love these clear swatch sticks for my polish collection. It helps me organize them and find the perfect color. I like that they're clear so you can place the ones with glitter toppers, etc, over other colors to see how they would look together. I like to keep them organized by color on binder rings. They're great to have when you have that growing collection and don't want to forget any of the colors you have when they are all packed away and not on display. It is the perfect way to show clients or friends whose nails you're going to do what colors you have without having to pull out ALL the bottles. And you really can't beat the price! These are a steal and i have ordered quite a few for the ever growing collection!"
RXFZHUNG3288T,Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent - Dont sweat it!,"I received a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free as part of a review Promo.<br />Even though I sometimes dislike using my body as a guinea  pig, I was excited to give this product a review.  I live in the south - where it is EXTREMELY humid during the summer months.  Because of this, it is hard to find an Antiperspirant/Deodorant that can be applied without the with marks AND prevent sweat marks - and keep you smelling fresh and clean without continuous application through out the day.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Secret Outlast Completely clean.  The product went on smoothly and dried quickly.  I did not feel so self conscious about body/sweat odor.  On my initial use, I did however feel that I had to keep checking to make sure the product was working - out of nervous habit and because the scent is not over powering or very noticeable after a few hours.<br /><br />I am only rating it 4 stars - and here is why - after using my sample (it was a small travel size, only lasting a week) - I purchased a full size because I really like the product.  However, upon realizing the cost for the product, I was disappointed.  Having a good deodorant/antiperspirant is very important to me - however - the overall cost is important too.  And I feel that the gel product is easy to waste while dispensing the product."

So I thought I would surprise him and purchase him one. The brush itself is very well made. Not cheap looking at all. If anything it seems like it would have been very expensive but I thought it was a great retail price! The bristles are wonderful because they aren’t too hard and they aren’t too soft so you can really get a good exfoliation. The little massage beads on the other side are just an added benefit, they feel amazing on your skin!!<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."

R189EU5O0PXI8S,"Feels light, great moisturiser","My wife used this during her first pregnancy and is using it during her second as a body massage oil. Needless to say, she loved it enough to go for it the second time. Her feedback is very positive on this product and uses it on a daily basis. Neither of us found the lightly scented fragrance overbearing or the oil too sticky. Will recommend to anyone."
RF4YXIKMVACQ1,Didn't work for me.,"This blush is easy to apply with a brush, which gives me the most natural looking finish.  It's creamy and blends easily and the color is perfect for my light skin.  It looks like a natural flush.  However, when I applied powder over it (Urban Decay Naked Loose), the color changed from a bright pink to more of a corally shade.  I don't know why this would have happened, but I didn't like the effect but it was too late to go back and do my makeup all over again.  When I purchased this shade, I wanted a true pretty pink shade and the shift in the color is the reason for my mediocre review.  The color did last most of the day, however.  I've decided that you get what you pay for so I'm sticking with my Nars Mulitple stick blush and will purchase a light true pink instead of using this NYX stick blush.  The finish on the Nars blush is a little powdery but it doesn't change color when set with powder.  That's the last thing I want.  Yes, NYX is affordable, but if the product is less than satisfactory, then you've wasted your money, although it may be a small sum.  I much prefer getting the result I want over the damage to my pocketbook.  I won't make the mistake of using another NYX cream blush, because every single one may change shade in some way.  If you want a nice pink blush but don't need to set this with powder, then by all means, try this one.  As for me, I'm going back to Nars.  I definitely don't recommend this product."

I have used the other varieties (red, green) of L'Oreal Sulfate-Free shampoos and never had any issues with a lack of lather. But this shampoo was awful. I used it for a week and threw it away."
R3BUDCPDON8WQO,A great cleanser which you must try!,Great ingredients. I kind of know the ingredients of skin care products well. This one just softly but effectively cleans your skin. I could tell it when I searched all cleansers on Amazon & finally found this with its great ingredients chart. It truly cleans skin as the way I thought. I also bought one for my mom. I may not change my cleanser for next months.<br />It does not has that much bubble. But it will have enough bubble for cleaning the whole face as the little amount described in product using instruction. Some people may not know how to produce bubble properly when using it. Feel free to ask me.
R206OE1C3N1XDY,Five Stars,Nice!
R2F50ZW1SBOFLQ,Silky soft and leaves my skin looking and feeling beautifully nourished. High quality and no reactions on my sensitive skin.,"I love the way this body cream leaves my skin! I use it on my arms, chest, stomach, legs and heels. I do not use it on my face because it contains cetyl alcohol which tends to break me out. This cream absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves me incredibly soft. I apply it in the evening after my shower and my skin stays soft and hydrated through until the next evening's shower. The tops of my arms get really dry, it doesn't seem to matter what lotions I use and they only give me a couple hours of nourishment. This really is the first cream I have found that actually works to keep them looking nice and itch free all day long.<br />Before I began using this I used Argan Oil religiously for moisturizing, and it worked beautifully. Argan Oil doesn't absorb immediately however and I end up greasy for a good 20 minutes or more after application. I have to v be careful not to lean against the couch or a wall and it has ruined one of my favorite shirts because I didn't give the oil enough tome to absorb properly. This cream absorbs so fast and by the time I finish rubbing it in I'm ready to get dressed. I absolutely love it!<br />I have extremely sensitive skin and most products break me out in ugly rashes that itch so bad. I've been using this cream nightly for a couple weeks and haven't had any problems. That was the main reason I had switched over to argan oil in the first place. Ednae Cream is such a better option! It is most definitely a high quality product. It is whipped and light and has just a slight sweet scent. I'm very impressed with how well it mouisturizes and the price is amazing! I really can't remember the last time I was so pleased with a purchase.<br />I did receive my jar free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my personal experience and honest opinion after using this myself."

But neither does the rest of the Murad products. Overall, no complaints. Will be buying again."
R2XPXXUU2AH3DC,Like the feel of this serum on my skin,"Like the feel of this serum on my skin. Running an experiment on my hands. Left hand gets the serum, right does not. I think I'm seeing a difference but waiting to see if there is more dramatic difference in the month to come. Face looks brighter. Will update this review later. I also bought a Vitamin C toner and a Vitamin C facial moisture cream."

R3OQBQNK56AFQQ,Bright and FUN!,"My daughters LOVED these Metallic Tattoos!<br /><br />We got them about a week ago and they were picking out their favorites within 5 minutes of opening.<br />-Easy to apply.<br />-They did stick and they did all apply evenly which is a problem with some other brands.<br />-Removal was simple, with some soap and warm water.<br />These did stay on for about 2/3 days easily on average. My daughters also took small glitter pens and were able to trace out the design for a more 3D look.<br /><br />These are definitely worth the money!<br /><br />*I did receive this product for review. All opinions and thoughts are my own and honest."

R311ARBMMIEMEM,Excellent customer service.,"I wanted to let you know that I called customer service because of a billing issue that occur due to my fault.  I was so surprised to talk to such a nice, positive young lady by the name of Nikki. She was extremely helpful, knowledgable, cheerful and understanding. Nikki displayed very good customer service skills and she listen and did an outstanding job. I felt like it was was my lucky day. Thanks You Nikki for making my day!"
R322FQJNXVW1CM,This product is great when left on your hair for deep conditioning,"This product is for African American hair or dreds, but I have coarse, unruly hair and decided I would give it at try! It is made in the USA, so it gives me total confidence in this deep conditioning. This product is great when left on your hair for deep conditioning. I used this twice as a deep conditioner. I put it on my hair, then put on a shower cap and left it on for about an hour while I did laundry and housework.  After I rinsed it off, my hair felt wonderful. I didn't have as many flyaways, and I found that my hair required a lot less styling products. I curled it and it didn't frizz up like normal, and the conditioner didn't leave any residue on my hair. I like the fact that the bottle is shrink wrapped so if you have any leakage, it doesn't get on anything else during shipping. This conditioner is full of healthy natural ingredients that are wonderful for your hair.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
R3GSLU09TKT7YT,Would not purchase,"I would like to start by saying that I rarely write reviews on products unless I have a reason to. Which brings me to the point that this razor is not what the description tells you. Multiple cuts on my face and neck, very loose pieces on item, poor construction, overall lack of a decent product. I do not recommend this to anybody. Purchase if you would like just be forewarned it is not what you think"

I have really fine hair, and can usually use a razor for a long time. This one didn't do a great job, and the blade dulled and caused razor burn really quickly."

R1LGCOUYTRR56,Doesn't deliver results,"The cream is ok, but certainly not worth the price tag!  Especially since it had no effect whatsoever for firming or contouring. I am using up the rest of the tube because I paid so much for it!  Save your money."

RCBYZR1Q3KVFC,Good quality.,Everyone thinks its mine. The part is so natural and it is so soft. Good quality.
RW3MS8GNEXRDP,Did Not Work,"Mixed it with Manic Panic cotton candy, just like the instructions said, used the whole bottle and them just a little bit of the cotton candy because I was looking for a pastel pink, and my hair came out looking EXACTLY the same. I was SO disappointed. I tried it before with conditioner like all the youtube videos show you and it did work but was not even. I thought this would work better as it was from Manic Panic. but no go. I think maybe I didn't add enough of the cotton candy to it, but I mixed it until the color was a  little darker than what I would have wanted on my hair, so I don't think that was the issue. I agree with other comments, save your money and use white conditioner instead."
R3FIC1HFWIB1SQ,Four Stars,Loved the organized lip products in my drawer. I can easily find what I need.
RF3RP1GW18AMP,Fanci0Full Temp Hair Color Works as Described,The Fanci-Full TEMPORARY Hair color is just that - temporary.  Which for me right now is good. I wanted to take some of the grey/white out of my dark brown hair allowing the chocolate color blend the grey's in.  This sometimes take two applications.  No matter.  The color stays in for at least a few days until you wash your hair again.  What I find very nice is the color did not rub off on my pillowcase overnight even if I was perspiring in the night.  As a temporary color I find this product does the job for the price.
R1JME2EDQI8MB9,Nail oil has Bad Bottle design. Spills out and is wasted if bottle tips over and it will.,"This product tipped over and spilled the total contents out the first day, even with that I used it a few days to see how it worked. All I could figure is it is kind putting olive oil on your nails.  Certainly not worth the high price I paid. Wish It could be returned for my money back.  Going to try a biotin vitamin now for my nails."

RXB2AW8KS10IW,Scents are hit or miss,"This review describes my opinion on the various lines of Mrs. Meyers hand soap that I have tried so far.<br /><br />Basil: Mild and herby. Although a bit boring, the earthy smell isn't overwhelming and has the potential to be a staple.<br />Apple: Smells like freshly cut apples... delicious! Matches my previous favorites from Bath and body works in terms of high quality (not chemical-smelling) aroma, and the strength of the aroma. Love it, but makes me wonder if such a strong aroma can be derived without chemicals.<br />Honeysuckle: Hated it. Too sickly sweet, too overpowering an aroma.<br />Radish: Found this at Marshall's, I actually like it! It is closer to basil in strength of aroma and earthiness, and makes the perfect kitchen hand soap.<br />Lemon Verbena: A classic, can't go wrong with it. It does end up smelling a bit like the rest of the handsoaps, though."

R1PMEILWZKNLR0,Cute; hard to match,"I love these. However... I am having a hard time finding things to actually wear with it because of the colors. Almost everything I own has a pattern on it already so there is a clash. I should have ordered solid colors. They look very cute on, I am thinking about putting a thin strip of shelf liner on one side of them to prevent the slippage without needing to use bobby pins."
R239F80LWK7P88,Irritated my face.....,"Sadly, I was unhappy with hos this item reacted on my face. My face was irritated and had a slight burning sensation, to where I finally washed it off. Was hoping this product would have worked for me, after buying it on a friend's referral, at a discounted price due to a promo code on their web-page on Amazon. I don't have sensitive skin, so not sure what the problem was."

R2HA1SCUA2SRT7,Great coverage and overall look but a little messy,"This product goes on like a dry shampoo powder, so it takes some practice getting it onto your roots without coating your scalp and forehead. I also read you're supposed to hairspray your roots after using it to get it to stick, which every woman should know is a terrible idea. However, I have had a good experience with it, even without using hairspray. It's not a miracle worker, but it definitely eases the transition from my dark roots to my medium-red hair. It also seems to be lasting awhile even though I feel like I use a lot of it. I like the translucent shimmer it has built into the powder. Overall, I recommend it. It makes me feel much more confident in my redheadedness between trips to the salon."
R29M229QET8HW8,omgawd,I like it. It soften my hair like the rest of the ogx shampoos and conditioners. I like the smell I like the color and it really does help your thicker.

It works just as well as the more expensive Minoxidil products, but they all could be a little better.  My hair is getting thin on top and on front on my forehead. I was skeptical at first, but this stuff really works! I have only been using it a couple of weeks and there are very small hairs and fuzz coming on. I'll post updates soon ."

It doesn't leave a greasy residue like other oils I have tried in the past, and my skin is silky smooth. It is perfect as an after shave moisturizer. Before I started using it on my hair, my hair was really frizzy and dry. Now my hair is shiny and smooth.

R2O47MEK2PJKIJ,"Good product, but colored version vs. original--uncertain.","This dry shampoo is pretty effective. I have tried the blonde colored one and the original and I think they are both good, although the benefit with the blonde one is that it is actually good for covering up highlight roots in between salon visits. However, my scalp often looks yellow after I use it (even after the product has absorbed into the rest of my hair). Also I think the original smells better. Make sure when you use this product to wipe off the nozzle after each use; otherwise it will clog up. The bottle doesn't last very long if you use dry shampoo frequently. But anyway, overall, it's a fine product and easy to use."

R4XTAH49Q4OCX,It definitely works better with wet hair,My daughter cries every time I brush her hair. She refuses to let me cut it so it is long and gets lots of tangles. We decided to try this brush and it has been so much more bearable. It definitely works better with wet hair. It still works better than other brushes in dry hair but it does pull more than it does wet. I even like to use it because I feel like it is more gentle on my hair and doesn't break it off as bad.

R6S63R2JOYO6S,Works great for certain areas but not for legs,"I only paid $12 for this through Amazon Warehouse deals, and I am very happy with this shaver.  I think it's also very inexpensive on the Panasonic website with free shipping, so keep that in mind.  This shaver is great on underarms, bikini areas, and knees - any skin area that can be stretched a little bit.  It takes a couple of passes to become hair-free, but I love it.  It works on legs but always leaves stubble.  It is not stubble you can see, but you can feel it, so if you want smooth legs, I don't recommend it.  For the price, I would definitely buy it again even if it stops working in a few months, and will keep buying it.  I wouldn't bother getting any replacement foils or blades, they would cost more than just getting a new shaver."
R15WDIRBBGPXE7,Great for a natural-looking tan.,"I love this bronzer. With careful application you get a really natural-looking tan.  The fragrance is nice too. Not too strong  The color lasts for days, and doesn't fade in the sun or wash off while swimming."
R36N8K9JPPFYJM,Not a fan,Not a fan on this one.  Felt too slimy and I didn't think it worked well for me.
RSQ8HOOY5U4QG,Great for Midwest hard water,"I'm really impressed by this shampoo!!! Ever since I moved to Wisconsin, I've been having a lot of hair trouble. I was using the same shampoo & conditioner that I used in New York & had good results with, but after a couple months in Wisconsin, my scalp started to really dry out and my hair became really dull and gets tangled easily. I thought maybe switching to a more natural shampoo would help. Nope, that only made the matters worse. While most natural shampoos are good for the general health of my hair, they're usually not moisturizing enough for my dried out scalp & ends of my hair. I kid you not, I have tried at least 4 different kinds of natural shampoos and 2 different kinds of shampoos that contain silicon/sulfate/harmful things in the past year. Most of the bottles are 3/4 full because they didn't work. I even installed shower head filter to try to make the water a little softer. Then I tried this shampoo out of desperation. It really worked! Best $10 I've ever spent! My hair felt SO much lighter after using this shampoo (followed by a natural conditioner, though I definitely want to try the Malibu conditioner now!). I used to get these dandruff-like flakes on my head, which I stupidly tried to treat with dandruff shampoo and dried the heck out of my scalp. Those were actually mineral buildup, because they went away right after using this shampoo! Unlike other sulfate-free shampoos, this one leaves my hair nicely moisturized. Now I need to get a bigger bottle!!!"

R117BZIK5CLX7Y,Ultimate odor protection,"Secret outlast clear gel is a effective and best deodrant in the market. This smells really amazing and leaves no white marks whatsoever, unlike any other deodrant that claims to be clear gel but still leaves marks on your clothes. I have tried every brand of deodrant that sells clear gel ones and claims to be not leaving any marks but secret outlast beats them all, absolutely must have on my dresser now. Got this as sample in my bzzkit for testing purpose but now it has become staple in my daily routine."

I've used this product line as long as I can remember and it's never let me down. I highly recommend it and will continue to use it, especially now that I've found it on Amazon.com and I can get it delivered fast and won't have to unchain myself from my home office long enough to leave the house. :-)"
R2GZISIYT5ZSK9,Broke out with cysts.,"Such a shame because I was excited about having a natural, charcoal soap. I'm 28 years old and have mild adult acne, and after using this soap for a week, I broke out with three cysts on my face — I haven't had cysts in years! Super disconcerting. Maybe it's one of those things that you have to keep using it for a month, and then your face will miraculously clear up entirely or something. I can't suffer with a terrible complexion for that long, though. Such a shame.<br /><br />Because of all the good reviews, I can only guess that it's different soap for different people. I just thought it important to warn other people, in case they experience the same thing."

R2FJPB4FOU7XLU,Not Boar Bristles,"Purchased this ACE brush to replace the one which I have had for more than 5 years.  I expected, as advertised, that the brush would have 100% boar bristles.  It does not.  The bristles look and certainly feel like plastic and are very harsh on the scalp. Hot water will not soften the bristles.  Would not purchase again."
R229VMW0HFKO9M,Great Razor!,"Bought as a replacement for a 1958 Gillette Fatboy that was my grandfather's. The fixed blade is equivalent to a setting of 3 or 4 on the adjustable Gillette razor. I've been using for about a year. Feather blades work best, the Derby blades it comes with drag too much."
RBBFJ39G1D43A,Mrs Meyers soaps are my favorite,"I like Meyers Lavendar hand soap very much as their company use natural ingredients, which I feel is very important for one's  health.  I know it comes in several different scents, but I enjoy using the lavender one.  I  was surprised when I received my order last week that this refill bottle had no cap just the white seal cap.  It refilled my hand soap bottles just fine.  Mrs Meyers has some great products which I use  three: hand soap, dish soap, and all purpose cleaner."

R2OZAMLX13UVQC,I love Vitamin C.,"I am not going to repeat what had been said about benefits of using this. What distinguish this particular Vitamin C serum by Radha is:<br />1) At 2 oz (60 ml) this is a pretty big sized bottle. My bathroom is full of serums and most are only 1 oz, which is half of this one, but priced similarly.<br />2) What made a very good impression on me, is that contrary to most of the other serums, this one was foiled when I got it, so if you want to buy a Vitamin C to gift it, get this one. I love opening new packages, so that I know, that nobody touched it before me.<br /><br />Vitamin C is the best remedy I came across and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I was sent this product for evaluation."

I did start using it a few weeks after I finished my box of 3D Crest Professional Effects strips (best ever), but I could tell that it kept stains at bay and made sure my teeth were extra white. I'm so much more confident with my smile now (goodbye, yellow teeth) and will def be using the system in between the whitening strips. Thank you, Crest!"

R23WKHDN6UJIA1,Works great!,I was fortunate enough to receive a box of Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing & Whitening System for free through Crest and BzzAgent.<br /><br />I started using this whitening system for about 4 weeks and I can honestly say I am impressed. Only a few days after using this product I noticed my teeth getting whiter. I have used other teeth whitening products in the past and have found them to be expensive and take too much time. Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing & Whitening System is priced lower than the majority of other teeth whitening products and only requires you to brush your teeth for two minutes. The only cons I found was that the deep cleansing toothpaste is a little gritty and I'd prefer more of a mint flavor. Even though it is not very minty it does leave my mouth feeling very clean. Overall I am very happy and would recommend this product.
R3JDGOGYZSKWOO,love it,"Beautiful shade of bright, dark red! Not orange toned or chalky matte looking. It goes on smooth and doesn't bleed around my lips. The tube is beautiful too!"

The soap is beautifully scented and soft, without drying your skin out. The lotion is just thick enough to pump easily but also to keep your skin soft and lightly scented. It's kind of weird to have the refill be a part of the set (I have the set for just the lotion and smaller soap dispenser) but at least you know where your refill is!"

R3RIJ50PEGBTDS,WORST PURCHASE ON AMAZON SO FAR,"I bought this for my mom, I just received it a couple of days ago and the product seems to be either a copy (not original), from a very old production batch or a deffective dispatch. The color of the box is very faded (seems like the box is old), the color of the perfume is almost transparent and WORSE of all inside the bottle there are small particles (like little pieces of paper). The scent is very weak and doesn't last even for half an hour. This is the worst product I have received from AMAZON so far."

My hair used to look more dull and dry. This Youth Boost line gives my hair a sleek look while leaving it soft and manageable. The shampoo lathers well, cleans well and rinses off easily. The scent is floral and isn't too strong.<br /><br />The Tresemme Youth Boost product line appears to be similar to the Dove Advanced Hairs series Youthful Vitality line that I have also tried. Both are great but I prefer Dove since it smells better to me and is slightly cheaper."

R2J1ZXZYKH8MJ5,Good for the money,"Works good, they only problem is that it sometimes binds up when cutting thick hair. It comes with a oil and if applied regualarly it cuts smooth. The variety off cut sizes, and reliability makes it a good product for the money, would recommend it to anyone."

R29A7KXVAGDSKG,Great news.,I have extremely sensitive teeth. I can’t even drink cold water without actually wincing in pain sometimes. So I am actually scared at what bleach or whatever can do to my teeth. I don’t know what’s in these whitening products. Whatever is in this one doesn’t affect me too much though. I use it about once a week and it whitens my teeth. No issues. Great news.
R3HQS4H2P7OTQB,Reflecting on reflector.......,"Can't recommend this item...<br />Aesthetically. it's ugly - a big, heavy blob of shiny, black plastic.<br />Can't imagine keeping it a handbag ( as has been suggested by others ).<br /><br />But more important -  it's poorly designed:<br />Given the awkward placement of the on/off light switch - it's too easy to accidentally leave it in the on position and deplete the batteries post haste.  Which I did.<br />(By the way, be warned - stingy seller does not even include the 2 required to use the item).<br /><br />In sum...a disappointment all 'round."

But I love the leopard double eyeliners so I thought I'd give it a try. I purchased it last month and I've used it everyday since. I love this product!!!! I was using two faced better than false lashes, and this is basically the same thing and literally more than half the price.  The fibers are not loose enough though, so I go back and forth using the fibers from this, and the fibers from the two faced. Super easy to wash off too. But I totally recommend this product for those who are like me and have short eyelashes. It's worth the price. !!!!"
R1XK2MOQZEZRQ6,Pretty decent,It's good for the money but the reviews were correct about the plates not closing all the way together except for at the end. This causes it to pull my hair and it's obviously a bit uncomfortable. It does heat up quick and straightens hair well if done in bigger chunks.

R23RI15DCJUYRU,Nooo,Not foundation. More like brown sunscreen
R3Q3CXE61GBXHH,Really like these,"Very cute and stay in well. However, the fingers are curled so they don't stay flat to your head and can be hard to put in.

R3ODWUVU72H5VV,The light formula is better suited for blonde hair,All natural product and cruelty free.  The light formula is better suited for blonde hair.  Recommend applying on damp hair before blow drying. It helps to seal in the oil when the hair shaft is still open.

They actually cleaned my face with just water...it took my concealer and powder right off!  I even tested it by using a makeup remover wipe after using the ClearCloth and no makeup came off on the wipe.  I am highly impressed!  My face was a little red after using the cloth but I think that may be due to me scrubbing too hard...the cloths are, however, very soft and gentle to the touch.  After using the cloth I just rinsed with warm water and hung to dry for the next use...I love that this product is eco-friendly!"

R1NDG3TDAHALKX,Added moisture without weighing down my fine hair.,"This product adds moisture to your hair, without weighing it down.  I have very fine, thin hair.  I used the recommended 2 pumps of this and distributed it evenly to my hair.  It is creamy, not greasy and has a mild scent that dissipates after several minutes.  I then blow dried my hair.  I noticed a lot less frizz on the ends of my hair, due to the added moisture.  My naturally wavy/curly hair was still easy to style.<br /><br />If you are looking for a product to add moisture to your dry hair, without weighing it down, then give this a try!"

R9S45XIP8EOXR,Outstanding value!,"This is what is known as a great value - above average quality for the price paid (less than $12).<br /><br />The construction appears to be outstanding (very few things made in Japan are of poor quality, I think) and it functions well.  This razor is much lighter weight than the normal all-metal DE (double edge) razors because of the plastic handle and guard.  The enclosed Feather-brand blades work flawlessly and the lightweight plastic case will work well for traveling.<br /><br />I have smaller than average man hands (glove size 8) and the only improvement that I would suggest in the design of this razor is to make the standard-sized handle an inch longer.  However, this does not detract from the value of this razor.  While I have only owned this razor for a few days, I predict that it will last a very long time.<br /><br />As a final note, the butterfly-opening top is a much easier design for cleaning than the design where the top comes apart.  I remove the blade and wipe it with the corner of a hand towel after rinsing it off (after shaving) as well as rinsing off the razor itself.  I then lay the blade back in the open butterfly-style top for drying until I use it next.  I have a coffee mug on my bathroom vanity where I place it so it stands upright to dry (and leans slightly to one side like a pencil in a coffee mug).  I also use &#34;Shave Secret&#34; shaving oil (MUCH better than creams, gels, or soaps, in my opinion) so cleaning it after each use keep the excess shaving oil off of it as well.  (I purchase the Shave Secret shaving oil at my local Walmart for $3.82 plus sales tax - that's cheaper than any online price including Amazon.)"

However, due to their design and size, they might not work so well for thinner shorter hair. The hinged clip works well for adapting to different thickness of the hair that you want to hold."
R1LOVOKFEO47TL,Best sponge ever.,"Absolutely love these sponges. I usually use brushes for my CC cream, but they leave streaks. The pink sponge is my favorite and left my face looking flawless. I couldn't be happier with this product. Recommend to everyone! And it came with cleaning instructions! Definitely getting more pink ones. Thanks!"
RH30QDPYCLLLK,Love this stuff!!,"Love this stuff!!!  I was buying it a local hair salon and decided to check for it on Amazon.  Now, I buy the bulk liter sizes instead of the smaller sizes at salon.  This stuff really works!  I use the shampoo, conditioner and leave in spray conditioner as a 3 part regimen to protect from undesirable pests getting in my kids' hair at school.  I have tried a few other brands of Tea Tree shampoos and I can assure you that Fairy Tales works the best.  It also smells good and feels nice."
R1FYZ25XVMA7FY,Autism and Epsom salt,"I'm very impressed with this product. I do this Epsom salt bath for my 2yo autistic son every other day. I didn't expect the salt can help him so much. We tried a lot of different things for him but this one is the best. He had a sound sensitivity, he was shaking his head non-stop when he heard a microwave or vacuum cleaner. But the next day after the first Epsom salt bath he stopped paying attention to those sounds. It's a month since we do this bath and he doesn't have sound sensitivity anymore! This is great! Thanks for this product.I would recommend this Epsom salt to all parents of autistic children."

R3RQ37QG7MD15D,A great tasting whitening system!,"Thanks to Bzz Agent I got to try Crest 3D daily cleansing and whitening system for free.  I was a little concerned about the 2-step system, but quickly discovered that it wasn't so bad and you should really brush your teeth for that long anyway.  There have been several whitening products I have used in the past, but this was the best tasting by far.  Step 1 was a nice minty flavor that left my mouth tasting really fresh and clean.  The second step is the whitening gel and although it didn't have a minty flavor it did not have a nasty bitter flavor like other whitening products.  I really appreciated the pleasant taste.  As for the whitening I noticed within a week the difference it was making.  The price is steep, however since it comes packaged like toothpaste it will last a long time.  Definitely considering this as a new part of my daily routine."

Tea tree oil is all natural, a natural anti bacterial, and will clean and clear your face free of chemicals. Just hold a damp cotton pad over it, tip the oil upside down really quick to get a tiny bit on it and put it on your face but not near your eyes."

Most of the time if it doesn't pinch my skin, it will pull my eyelash. I'm so glad I found this Beauty Lashious Pink Eyelash Curler because it didn't pinch my skin and it rarely pull my not so thick eyelashes. I also like that it's an ergonomically designed for you to use three fingers without a problem. This helps when I am pressing the curler to give it more pressure for better bend on my lashes. One tip though if you want to last the curl longer use a waterproof mascara this will hold it better than the non waterproof one. This is now my favorite curler.I was lucky enough to be able to purchase this for a discounted price in exchange for my objective and equitable review."
R1VZ7BF5U6VWMC,Don't waste your money - buy the real thing,"I bought this two part system at Wal Mart totalling about 14.00 dollars. I have previously used the Red Carpet gel system with the UV light. You don't get the same results at all and I followed the directions completely. I applied it in the morning and by 4:00 of the same day, it was peeling off. With the UV Red Carpet, I could expect great looking nails for two weeks minimum and they were hard and growing. Don't waste your money on this non UV light supposed &#34;gel polish&#34;. I took it back to Wal Mart and got a refund. I will stick with the tried and true Red Carpet gel and use my UV light."

R2L1OOYNELESRC,Love this color!,I have been using this hair color for 4 years (formerly 22) and I get so many compliments on the color of my hair.  Easy to apply and the color looks fabulous!
R255MJ3J9CH1MC,"Nice formula, pretty color","I received this product for free to review.  I was at first afraid of the color.  In the packaging it looks dark and very sparkly.  However, once I swatched it on the back of my hand, I was surprised.  It was a very smooth formula, no glitter but still had a nice shine.  The color was more lighter than I thought it would be.  It is a nice berry tone with not too much red and not too much purple.  On the lips, it is just beautiful.  This lipstick does have to be reapplied every so often, but it wears nicely.  I think it's a great lipstick.  Most longwear lipsticks are uncomfortable because they dry down matte.  This one I wouldn't say is longwearing, but it has average staying power."
REW6LB3XVUQQN,They're good.,"They're cheap, they don't break apart and they don't cut into your gums. Not much else to say about floss is there?"

R22VSPH480HDOS,Dry and clear,"I tried secret outlast clear gel and was skeptical before I sampled it. However, I was so impressed! I had never tried a gel deodorant before, but I love how it glides on smoothly and simply. I also love that you don't get any white deodorant marks or stains on your clothes! As for performance, it outlasted my expectations. I put it through the ringer by exercising and running errands with my kids without showering in between. I couldn't believe how fresh I still felt after arriving home. I may become a deodorant convert now...thanks, bzzAgent!"

R1FYJFCYR9787X,Solutions,"This conditioner has worked better than most other conditioners I have used. My hair is long, about 8\\"" below my shoulders and I am constantly attempting to keep it in good shape.<br />This product says it is infused with Omega-3 and antioxidants. The directions are much the same as other conditioners- apply from mid length to ends and wait 2-3 minutes,  then rinse out.<br /><br />It does seem to leave my hair shiny and smooth without looking or feeling oily. The tangles smooth out with my hairdryer's comb. It seems to do the job and I always appreciate products that let you, or are designed to be stored upside down so that you get the full amount of the product out of the container easily."
R1HSS65KK78OJH,by far the best lotion for an even tan,by far the best lotion for an even tan. I used this at the salon and it is expensive but Amazon had a GREAT  price. Thanks!
R2RQVE7RF96939,On my fourth bottle. Love it for face and body.,"I've purchased this over and over again and it's awesome! Makes my skin so smooth both on my face as well as bumpy parts of my body. No more face or body acne with this. And it's really inexpensive! I have normal skin and don't need to use an additional moisturizer after for night time. No more chicken skin on arms, back of thighs or butt. Smooth skin on face, neck and chest. It's a winner."

My smile was whiter and brighter after the first use."

R1V65A8K5F2FVE,does as it says and actually does smell pretty horrible. But then,"Works well, does as it says and actually does smell pretty horrible. But then, what would one expect with Liquid Latex, which is really what this stuff is. The caveat is that when you use this for a border to protect the nail bed from the nail polish, it ends up clinging to the nail polish and then when you go to pull it off it takes off the polish with it. Not really for me, but they gave me a full refund, so thanks."
RAKXV1F1ORW9F,Miracle product,Shipping was incredibly fast and this product is AMAZING!!! You can see results from the first time you use it and it just keeps getting better. My hair was in really bad shape from being over processed and this is really fixing it. I'm so happy I have not had to cut all of my hair off and start over with growing it back out.
RN80SCW4V7NZT,Hate collogne deoderants? You'll love this!,"I bought this for my tween son who hates the strong cologne smell deodorants  He's happy with this and I like it, too.This smells like a little coconut with a little musk, so it doesn't smell like women's Secret Coconut Splash. It's still a man's deodorant, but I think a woman could wear it too. Some women find the men's deodorants work better and this is a really nice, fresh, not-too-strong smell."
R1BT3KMOXE3OOH,Best eyeliner ever,Best eyeliner ever. Doesn't smudge or fade and is very easy to take off at the end of the day. This seller is amazing too! I had s problem with the wrong quantity getting delivered and they fixed it quickly! Will buy again both because the product is amazing and also the seller is superb!!!

R2COTCI23AFMDU,Not for Rosacea,"I used these for about 2 weeks and didn't really see a huge difference. I suffer from chronic rosacea and as such my skin is easily irritated and reddened with bumps all over my t-zone. I was hoping that this product would be something that would help me clear up or at least lessen my flareups, but alas, I didn't really see results.<br /><br />I feel like these would work better for someone who simply suffers from acne or generally clogged pores, as they did make my skin feel fresh and clean. I guess I was expecting a bit too much :) Good product! Just not for me,.."

R16NWNUWU13YEU,Good Product,Like Dove body wash. They give you a lot of product for the price. This has a good smell. The fragrance could have been a little stronger and last longer though. This does a good job of getting you clean and doesn't leave your skin feeling dry.
R2JVUW8QZ28O2C,Smooth,I actually did a sample review of this a couple of months and liked it so much I switched over to this. I gives a much smoother shave over the Mach III.

It's not at all flimsy when held in your hand so it doesn't feel as though it will break if you accidentally drop it. Has a nice clamp/pin to hold it closed for travel or for when you place in your makeup bag. It did what it was supposed to do and it curled my lashes making them look longer with the help of my mascara. Overall, a very well made lasting product.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review"
R1D8C3OM6FUIGI,Four Stars,Good so far. New to beard products.
RM5GUK1SVFKLQ,It's great,"I love love love this! It smells soooo good. I have really long thick wavy hair, so I generally have to use a few pumps (even tho the consistency is thick) in order to cover all my hair. I leave it on for a few minutes, while I finish my shower, and then rinse it out. My hair smells so good after, and it is easier to brush out. I've been using this conditioner (as well as the shampoo) for almost 2 weeks now, and I've noticed that my hair is behaving a lot better. It's not as frizzy and looks glossy. And that's saying a lot because my hair was super dull and drab looking. Now it feels so healthy. I won't be purchasing any other shampoo and conditioner from now on."

R2FNS4PT8AMPY4,Have been very pleased with the result,Have been using this product for a few months to help correct a bald spot in my hair due to a prescription drug I was using to correct a dry patch in my scalp.  Have been very pleased with the result.  It's a slow process but hair is definitely growing back.  The price on Amazon is about $6.00 cheaper than what I was paying at my salon.

R1TKJFHICYYA29,Great sponge and fast shipping,"Great sponge and does the job, very fast shipping. The sponge will start to break off after so many uses but its a sponge so what do you expect.

R3QQHGMY603UI6,Good for the price,This wrap is good fit for men or women of many sizes. It's a little in the thin side but it serves it's purpose well for what it was purchased for. It's held up in several washes. Good product for the price.

RMCUG0KW1A1J6,I love this hair dryer,"I love this hair dryer!!  I have used many professional dryers and this one is hands down the best.  I had seen it a few times prior to buying but just<br />wasn't sure.  Then, I had the good fortune of experiencing this dryer in my Venice, Italy hotel room!  It dryers quickly with the proper heat and blowing power.  Somehow, it also seems to protect my hair from damage as well.  I am so pleased with this purchase.  Elchim dryers are a close second but I now prefer this one."
R3OOD4VPZUJ3ZN,It's finished within 2 weeks,"The lotion itself is good, light and not greasy  like a lot of other spray suncream. However, it goes very quickly. The design is to make half of the spray goes into the air and the whole bottle was used up before our 2 weeks' holiday ends - my husband and I were using it, we have no children. Not good value for money."

R2MPZESKZF2A2C,"Smells delicious, hair is so soft and less frizzy, just wish it was a bigger bottle for the price!","I really love this conditioner.  It smells delicious, but not overpowering, just a sweet vanilla scent.  It is also all natural ingredients which is very important to me.  My hair feels very soft after using and I notice less frizz.  My only complaint is that this is a small bottle for the price.  I've been trying to use it a little more sparingly, but it has still only lasted me about 3 weeks for every other day use for medium length hair.  I'm used to paying a little more for high quality products and ingredients, so I understand it, just not sure if this can be my everyday conditioner at this price point or I may have to alternate with another natural conditioner that is less expensive, but I do really love this!  I just re-ordered another bottle so I'm hooked for now and would like to try some of their other products too!"

RV0VB8PVARU9Y,Different smell,"I had purchased Pink's &#34;Lost in Love&#34; perfume at Victoria Secret.  Love the smell.  Once I ran out, I went back to VS to purchase another bottle.  They did not have the &#34;Lost in Love&#34; perfume in the store.  I went online and ordered this bottle which cost over $50.  I finally received the bottle in the mail.  It smells nothing like the initial bottle I purchased in the store.  This was a waste of $50 for me.  Very disappointed."

RZ9RIRUY4XXH6,The round nose trimmer head gets pretty warm after using it for a minute or two,"Feels really light and cheap. The plastic cap only fits over the round nose trimmer and the smaller trimmer. The bigger trimming head that faces sideways does not fit under the clear cap. The round nose trimmer head gets pretty warm after using it for a minute or two, and every-so-often will snag on my nose hair a little before it cuts it."

RM50JSLJIV34P,One Star,"used once then the top was glued on, not impressed with the product."
RGS4DSAE8IZSG,Can't recommend at this time,The only reason to buy this expensive product is if it works as claimed to thicken thin hair. No results yet but it's only been about 3 weeks so the jury's still out.<br /><br />The downside is that the product was shipped with a loose cap and some leaked out into the packaging...
RTU4VTC8E2XTD,Five Stars,It's helping me to do what it says it can do.
RJ34WCL3XM5JM,great product even without dead skin rolling off,"I've had this mitt for a few months now and don't always remember to use it. When I do though, it works wonderfully. I don't always get a ton of grey dead skin rolling off, but it still makes my skin super smooth. Please go gently though around thinner skin areas such as wrists and collar bones."
R1LCYPN88HT9LL,Awesome product,i received this product in exchange of my honest  review. this works amazing. my skin has never looked or felt better. its not greasy and gross like other products I've tried.I use this morning and night after cleansing.

RAG7PAUW5A1P8,WORTH THE MONEY,This toothbrush is definitely worth the money.  I bought the waterpik toothbrush set almost 2 years ago.  I really needed some oral help and the toothbrush was a bonus. I got it home and fell in love.  The toothbrush is gentle but yet very effective at cleaning your teeth. My teeth have never felt so clean.  Its very gentle on the gums as well!!!  I will never go back to a manual toothbrush.  The original toothbrush lasted almost a year and it came with 2 replacement brushes.  I think this works better than the colgate brushes and are cheaper.

R33RV1EPY88CCK,Mouth feel super clean!,I received the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing & Whitening System complementary from Crest.  I have used the product for several weeks and enjoy it.  It makes my teeth feel super clean and I have noticed a bit of whitening.  I have fairly sensitive teeth and this product has not bothered them.  It's a simple two step system that you do twice daily.  Step one you brush with (with out rinsing) and then brush with step two and rinse after.  I would recommend it for someone who is afraid to use the whitening strips due to sensitivity (like me).
RIUDC8X08HPDO,tasted great and kept my mouth feeling clean all day,"didnt burn my gums, tasted great and kept my mouth feeling clean all day!"

R1JZ2YVP5911JS,arrived in excellent condition & timely manner,the magic is in the makeup. arrived in excellent condition & timely manner. loved this makeup & skin care & fragrance selection.
R25WRUGWHP8R6M,Good makeup brush set,"Perfect brush set for your everyday makeup need, wooden handle is made of good quality wood, bristles are dense and soft. I have been using this set for ten days, and these are only brushes i am using for my makeup, your can perfectly blend foundation, concealer, highlighting, contouring and setting your makeup. Small brushes are good for precision application of concealer, setting under eye powder, highlighting. I have used flat top brush and tapered brush for fondation application, angled brush for contouring, Round brush for setting my face with loose powder, flat angled brush for blush and small tapered brush for concealer and small flat brush for setting under eye concealer.  They are really good quality brushes, easily comparable to high end brushes which are priced so high and does the same job. One thing i would like if the brushes had been marked on handle which brush is which one, as it's difficult to identify brushes according to shapes if you don't know much about makeup brushes and another thing i like to point out in description it says it comes with silver roll that you can use to carry your brushes and store brushes but actually it does not come with it. These are my two issues with it, other than that they are good quality affordable brush set you need for your makeup needs."
R2L7SRLTT8W0IJ,"Medium blue, NOT dark blue. NOT as dark as pictured.","It's not the deep rich blue they used to have. Not sure what changed with the formula, but this one is a medium blue. NOT DARK."
R284T4FVA5BINP,Like it but don't like the dropper,"I really liked using this but the issues is the dropper. I have to squeeze the dropper so many times to get the product.  Other than this, it's clear, and goes on the face nicely and dries to a clear finish. Does not leave any residue, not oily or anything."
R17RSIMIA8Y7Z9,Five Stars,"I love L'Oreal products, their colors in the daylight look natural unlike many other brands."
R2MLIQPYM6O626,Never dries,"It stayed wet, and just smeared everywhere around my eyes. Even blinking caused a huge mess. I got a little smudge of mascara on the tube itself and it wasn't dry even 4 days later. I really wanted to like it."

R1OPIGQ2QEZ63R,Four Stars,When my little sister is birthday I sent it to her.<br />She told me that it is great kit.
R2BYAUVRIS7ZLI,Amazing product!,This is amazing stuff! It works wonders to make my skimpy lashes fuller and longer!  I received this as a trial and I'm very excited about the results!  It is a very small bottle but when applying a small drop goes a long way. I noticed added length and volume to my lashes. You just brush a tiny amount on your eyelid lash line and it's as easy as that!
R18F95A5U41XXV,Five Stars,Placed droplets on water pipes and floor openings to get rid of ants and prevent further infestation. Works!
R774WH93EW4OJ,Perfect,Exactly as I had assumed. Same product as retail but much less expensive.
RPNCTJG9PFRQS,Excellent Product,"I purchased this for my 12 year old son whos hormones are out of whack. He's greasy and full of facial acne. He's not good at washing his face in the AM/PM which has made the problem worse.  I decided to try this after reading some reviews. It has worked wonders for my son and he has NOT applied it as often as I had wanted. However, I'm still seeing great results. I paid $19 for it in Amazon and that was a fair price. The price has increased a lot.  I'm not sure it is worth that much!  It is a very small jar.  The cream has a little scent, but it is not very strong.  It is very lightweight and rubs in easily with no greasy feeling.  It has a cooling affect on the skin.  Pictures are prior to treatment and after about a week of using the lotion.  ***Unlike many others on here, I did not receive my product free.  I was a paying customer.***<br /><br />Update 9/1/2016<br />I just purchased my second jar of this for my son.  We stopped using it after our jar ran out and his acne is back.  After just one night I could see a difference.  I am pleased with the product.  If I could get my son to apply it every night, I know his acne would clear up.<br />We did try the Keeva serum when this was unavailable but it did not work for us.<br />I don't know anything about this company, but I think they would have more people trying this of they stopped sending people free product for their &#34;honest&#34; reviews.  Real customers do not like paid reviews (I'm one of them).  If your product is good, you don't need them!!  And in my opinion, this product works."
R3CXDCL6RF48QH,Easy to use with a little practice,"I have tried every type of spray, gel, and mousse out there to try to get my thin, straight hair to curl. This curling wand is the only thing that has ever worked on my thin hair. Easy to use with a little practice. Curls last throughout the day with minimal touch ups. Even turn into nice waves the next day after sleeping on them. The rubber tip is nice to protect your ears/neck from the hot wand."
R2GHCRHFJAI4W4,Nice Brushes!!!,I just received my brushes and can you say amazing! The first thing that drew my attention theses brushes were the color. I love the color pink and this color is great in person. I adore the carrying case as I can fit it nicely in my purse without it taking up a lot of space. The brush themselves are super soft and apply makeup evenly over my face. Definitely a great set of brushes. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
RRU76LMKDP4RA,Not a Magic Wand but Still Great,"At first glance I was skeptical. I have tried whitening products in the past with no success. I did not have high hopes for this one either. The packaging was fine. The cardboard bottom could have gotten wet and possibly torn, but that is a little thing. A two part system, hmmmm....not so sure about this. Time to test. Upon testing I first notice the taste and texture of part 1, it was gritty and had a mild minty type taste. Not bad. I figured the grittiness served to scrub the teeth. Now for part 2. This seems to be a gel form of peroxide. It did not have the best taste to it, but it was bearable. I noticed a burn with part 2. The bubbles filled my mouth as my gums burned. It was not the most enjoyable experience, but I knew that it was like putting peroxide on a dirty wound. My gums were sensitive throughout the day. I continued this process for two weeks. Around day 4 the burning stopped. I noticed around week 2 a slight whitening, not a major difference. Over the 2 weeks of trials, I no longer had an issue with the taste or burning. Overall I like the product. It is a little burdensome to have it in 2 different tube, especially if you have to travel."
R14XXJ8FAU15MN,"Great result, its actually works","Great result, its actually works ! I tried it on my mom under eye and her puffiness disappeared. Also, it easy to apply."
R1Y1QGGOX8KVDX,Top Notch Non-Drying Daily Cleanser,"This is my go-to facial cleanser. I have moderate hormonal acne, and it helps to control it. Most importantly, &#34;hydrating&#34; is no lie. It does not leave a tight, dry feeling at all. Instead, my skin feels soft and smooth after using it. I'd recommend it for someone looking for a non-drying daily cleanser."

R16VSPESJUVH3R,Less hold & duration than Murray's but easier to wash.,"Good for the price. Less hold than Murray's, seems it lasts less time on your hair. On the bright side is easier to wash. Not a strong smell. Depends on what you prefer."

RMVEGK9ZOV18Q,Will not wash out!,"It gives great color for dark hair, but beware.  It makes your hair dry, chalky, and tangly.  Even adding tons of hair serum did not make a difference in curing the dryness.  I still got the achieved look and was happy with that regardless. However, I washed my hair three or four times and it still will not come out.  As you see in this picture, I am wearing the pink and the purple.  I am now dying my hair to cover this up. Also after you wash your hair, you still have that dry feeling.  I would say depending on your hair type, you may be okay with this.  I would recommend this only as an occasional use, and don't use very much."
R2U0DXDQ332CS0,Five Stars,its just as I ordered its great
R3QTI3PW7I59ZA,I love it!,A little goes a long way! You only need a very small amount so this tube will last long. It smoothens my skin and makes my foundation last longer! I love it!

RM58OKDNSVIRN,Smells good but stings her eyes and makes her cry,Bought this for our 4 year old. Smells good but stings her eyes and makes her cry. Not gentle.
R1KN8YWWKOBGYB,Good Deal,Wonderful! I tend to go thru mouth guards fairly quickly so I love that this comes in a pack of three. I have TMJ and have used several different mouth guards over the last 3 years. I just got this pack so I can't say for certain how long they will hold up. But from the look of them I think I can get about 6-7 months out of each one of them since they look and feel sturdy. So over all I think this is well worth the money.

RTOVHG4YAHFRB,"Amazing, flawless skin!!!!!!!!","Fantastic foundation with medium to max coverage, but natural and light undetectable. It costs a bit more, but the stick is very fat so a little swip covers significant area.  I have acne prone skin and have been using this stick for about two months without any breakouts.  I do sanitize the stick after using with a cosmetic sani-spray. Love this will purchase again."
RIVFJNQ8YE3YK,so maybe it's not as bad as it could have been without the cream,"I think it did help initially when I first got my burn, but I'm not completely convinced of its effectiveness. I know it takes months for it to work, so I can't say much, but my scar is still there. It is faint, so maybe it's not as bad as it could have been without the cream. Hard to tell."

My beard felt great and soft, not heavy but not as light with too much oil.  My beard blows i the wind around in the wind because this oil is so light."

R30ZW22TE2PF63,"Great, but too expensive","I loved this product -- it was gentle and effective, and it didn't have an obnoxious odor like so many home waxes. At the time of my purchase the large tub was a great value, but the product has tripled in price since then so unfortunately I'll have to switch back to a cheaper brand unless I can find it on sale."
R1LGNS6FS2Q4Q,Love! Love! Love!,"As always, MapofBeauty has never let me down with bang clip ins! I LOVE this store and I HIGHLY recommend it to every cosplayer and normal wig wearers out there! :)"
R2HZBM8H82LT4D,It provides such a beautiful and healthy glow to my skin,"I have been using this product for years and was surprised that it had been discontinued. It provides such a beautiful and healthy glow to my skin. I ordered right before my bottle ran out, but my order came so fast, that I received a new one within a few days or so with regular shipping. I had no issues and will order again, but maybe more than one, next time."

RYTJHRJSNAFDU,they are great!! Same design and fit as the Clarisonic ...,"For the price, they are great!! Same design and fit as the Clarisonic replacements for the Mia 2 but without the hefty price tag. I bought both the regular and the sensitive brushes and I did not feel a difference in the softness of the bristles. When I used the sensitive brush heads my skin was not irritated afterwards, so I call it win!"
R1PGJ5ED66Z0IZ,"Easy to use, cleared up teenage acne",My teenage son was suffering with some serious acne.  Washing his face consistently anytime while not in the shower was not on his list! lol<br />This product worked great.  He started using the product in the shower and again before bed and within 2 days you could really see improvement!<br />He says the product is easy to use and doesn't have a strong smell.  Really worked!
R755VHKZPOOGW,Slimmer and Better Me,"I've only used 2 of the packs and I seriously notice a difference. My pants are actually bigger. I'm not all toned up from it but I definitely look smaller. I was gratefully able to get this for a discounted price in return for an unbiased review and I'm really happy that I did. The reason I say that is bc I'm not one to spend lots of money on expensive products and probably would have never given this a try, but trying it has definitely proven to me that this would totally be worth the money. Warning** it's not a permanent fix, however, if you are needing it to fit into an old dress or pants or you simply are going to and event where you want to look your BEST then this is without a doubt the answer! I'm not sure how it does it but it basically shrinks and tightens, kind of like eliminating some extra water weight. I would suggest doing this with a few days of fluid pills to get the maximum effect! Love the product, keep up the great work"
R1118XFLDI5MP,Five Stars,Just what I needed at a great price!
R3BE15V86TETR9,Wouldn't recommend,First time using this product. I followed the instructions to the letter and the product still got onto my gums on my lower jaw. It stayed on for 5 seconds before i had to yank it out and wash my mouth for about 10 mins. My gums were completely &#34;fried&#34; (for lack of a better word). I was so scared and in so much pain. My gums changed color and stayed white and extremely painful for close to 45 mins. I am so scared that i am not going to use it again.

R1QHIXC1WWP2CL,My new favorite razor!,"I have really enjoyed using the razor! I have to shave each and everyday for my job and I have to say that the Braun Series 9 is the best electric razor that I have ever used!  It glides over my skin with ease leaving nothing but soft, smooth skin.  Its self-cleaning design makes the whole process easy and much less time consuming that regular electric razors. It has 4 individualized cutting options for different types of hair and is oh so gentle on my sensitive skin.  My wife loves the smooth results and I love the ease of use.  Overall this is a great new product from a trusted brand that I plan on using each and every day! I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand"

RYXBT6VPELE3L,The light would be better placed closer to the tip,"The light would be better placed closer to the tip, but considering the way these trimmers are built that'd be rather difficult to do. Either way it's a good nose hair trimmer that's sturdy enough to be dropped in the shower without consequence.  Not much else to say. It's a nose hair trimmer, and only a nose hair trimmer. It does the job well enough that you should pick one up if you have errant hairs irritating your nose.  Update: the blade cracked in half, and despite it being a single removable part I can't find a replacement for it. Something to consider, since with a failed blade I'm back to using scissors."
R37M6UQHHKIS2,Five Stars,Love this scent - heard they may be dc'ing it.  Very disappointed if that is true.
R184UWWCBU3SVZ,I really like this oil,"I really like this oil. I use tea tree oil for my acne, either diluted with water as an all over toner or pure as a spot treatment. Normal acne medicine like benzoil peroxyde doesn't work for me and only irritates my skin. This oil is strong but I can still use it undiluted without irritation. My partner likes to use it to cure and prevent toenail fungus. I've tried other brands and so far all seem to give me similar results but this is my favorite. This brand has a slightly better scent than the others. It's a herbal scent but not too pungent or too mild. The only con with this is it doesn't come with a dropper. Other than that this is a perfect product and I would reccomend it for anyone who is looking for a natural acne treatment."

I can only warn people that sonicaire changed the design, and now many of these will not work with the original product.<br /><br />I thought the references to the design merely referred to the tip, but the entire replacement is different, meaning it is likely not to fit if you do not have the latest device.<br /><br />I think it should be more clear as a warning, but it admittedly was cockpit error on my part, and the review is merely to prevent cockpit error on your part."

I have gotten movies that were not what I thought I was getting but kept them anyway but nothing totally unsuitable before."
R1J7E8EB4H4VYI,All assorted colors!,Received all assorted colors. Great product. Purchased from Olivia's Gift. Great seller!
R1WSR99FZRYBM8,"Great for deep cleaning, not so much for whitening","I got to try Crest 3D White Briliance Daily Cleansing & Whitening System for free thanks to BzzAgent. I love how well the deep cleansing toothpaste cleans. My mouth feels great after using the product and there isn't sensitivity like I have experienced with other whitening products. However, I did not notice any  significant whitening. My teeth are generally pretty white, but they could always be whiter, and that just didn't happen with this toothpaste.<br /><br />I really don't like the two steps. I spend two minutes with each because I want to make sure all my teeth are cleaned properly but that then doubles my brushing time. Some days, I just don't have that extra time. Also, I don't like the fact that it tells you not to rinse between the two. That just doesn't feel right to me. When I received my package, one of the tubes was opened and had leaked out slightly. I'm not sure whose to blame for that, but it is a turn off right off the bat.<br /><br />Overall, the deep cleaning really works and I love that. But it doesn't whiten much and it's just too expensive for toothpaste. I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to pay, just for the deep cleaning aspect."

R1PQWVIOL3I54V,DO NOT BUY THIS; COLOR IS WAY WAY WAY DARKER THAN ADVERTISED,DO NOT BUY THIS; 2 SHADES DARKER THAN SWATCH AND COLOR NAME. The beauty supply store suggested this brand; big mistake. I even called customer service for Satin after reading reviews saying the results were too dark. They told me that if you use the correct developer this will not happen. WELL I DID EVERYTHING THEY TOLD ME; MY HAIR IS SO DARK; NOT EVEN CLOSE. I used 6N which should be dark blonde; it is DARK DARK DARK brown. THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT CARE. DO NOT BUY THIS. Going straight back to Loreal Preference; I love it!

I find it amazing how it plumps up your wrinkles as they simply disappear. I also use it on the wrinkles above my lips and on my lips. It's highly moisturizing, is unscented which I really like and the pump works great. I received it at a reduced price to try and test as a consumer for review purposes. As a top reviewer, I've tried many brands of eye cream and gels and this is by far my favorite to date. I know it's a bit more pricey than the others but if you purchase it, prepare to be amazed. I love that it's made in the USA. It's worth every penny."

R2IMPGDKXO10XT,A favourite sunscreen for face!,"I didn't like this product at first, but it was because I dislike applying sunscreen and put on too much too quickly. I then tried applying less than a dime-size amount on my face and was able to blend it in perfectly. The white sheen you see when you first apply will quickly disappear as you blend it into your face, if you don't use too much of it. It also doesn't have the same smell as most sunscreens, which is nice. I don't think the product has any added fragrance but it's definitely a very nice light minimally noticeable smell. This product does make your face shiny at first, but that doesn't last too long. I also have drier skin, so the shininess doesn't bother me much. I also tend to be prone to mild - moderate acne breakouts and this has not aggravated my skin at all. This is a great sunscreen for those who want something that works great, requires minimal product, is vegan and cruelty-free."

R1SFXFVF66AFP4,Great defrizzer,"I have the most difficult frizzy hair and I have tried EVERYTHING to tame the frizz. As I get older the crown section of my hair gets drier, coarser and frizzier. This product is the only one that comes close to smoothing the frizz. You need only a small amount as it is heavy and easy to over do, but if you have thick hair that's very resistant to other defrizzing products, this one is the one for you."

R3MTL7XMZ5L3K8,Doesn't work that well for us,"This gel serum doesn't seem to work all that well for us. It does seem to work initially but after a few hours the definition begins to loose. Also, we have to use a good amount of this serum since the instructions say to saturate the wet hair with it. In doing so, parts of the hair end up looking a bit crunchy and stiff. We don't really like the results. Perhaps we don't have the right type of curls, that may work for you."
R3DUBNROLHGOK4,Great value buy.,"This is a great buy.  I love tea tree oil for many uses.  My most recent use is for lice. I mix 2 teaspoons with eight ounces of baby shampoo, and let it soak in the hair for at least thirty minutes.  I wash it out, rinse with a 50/50 vinegar mixture and then comb the hair out and repeat the wash.  I also use it on non infected persons to repel lice.  You can add a few drops of lavender oil to the mixture to improve the smell.  I also use tea tree oil for yest infections, disinfecting wounds, acne, toe nail fungus, rashes, and general cleaning. Make sure you dilute it some before applying it directly to skin.  At first the smell is a lot to take but you become accustomed to it over time.<br />The now brand tea tree oil smells and appears to be undiluted tea tree oil to me.  When I placed it on the skin it tingles, and the pungent smell is unmistakable. That being said this a good value at this price."

REBPD8CUFX8AR,Great Results in Just a Few Days,"This is an amazing product; after just three uses my teeth were amazingly white. It doesn't look fake; it just looks really clean. I am so happy. My teeth wasn't really bad to start out with but you I did have stains and some yellow discoloring. I used the strips once a day for about 50 minutes, before I brushed my teeth each morning (which was recommended). I started using it on Wednesday and now it's Sunday and my teeth look really clean. There is hardly a yellow tint or shade anymore. The only down side to this product is that it can cause pain to your teeth. I have had moments when I was just walking down the street and this striking pain just hit my tooth; the pain last for a couple of seconds. The product also leaves white dots on your teeth; I have one on one of my beaver teeth and its not cute. But my teeth is becoming whiter so I hardly notice the spot (either that or its fading away; so beware of that).<br />I love this product, my smile is just more lovelier now; even my friends have noticed it. I would recommend this product and I will personally continue to buy this. Its worth the price for a happy smile."
R2ETRRNLJLJP3R,Discontinued Vintage Rose :( happy to find some and delay the inevitable,"there is nothing like this color and it shines like gel but easy to remove.  Muted and elegant retro neutral rose color not screaming bright - classic! But oops, I guess nobody else wants low key nails? Apparently being discontinued and replaced with neon pinks and super bright colors in the reinvented Gel Envy line. Boo! :((  but I do love this product, it's a bummer."

R2IEIM621Z0M64,Lovely Foot Soak,"I have used this foot soak every day since I received it and my feet feel relaxed and refreshed after a nice long soak.  It has a pleasant odor and leaves your feet feeling soft and invigorated.<br />But it has done nothing to kill the toenail fungus, and that was my major concern.  I do use a topical treatment in addition to the foot soak, but there does not seem to be any improvement.<br />I will recommend this product as an effective foot soak, but, unfortunately, not as an effective treatment for toenail fungus."
R30OMD3T07N6C6,Five Stars,nice and cheap

RLEFLKW15DYTC,No more aging!,"I just turned thirty and I was starting to notice tiny little crinkles around my eyes, they are no longer noticeable and I just started using this product. I also have too many sleepless nights and used to notice puffiness and dark circles under my eyes; I no longer need concealer even on the worst mornings. This is amazing eye cream, I will never go another day without using it."
R9VHK0U2NCTWY,My favorite eye cream,My favorite eye cream. Delivery was fast and the product is exactly what I was expecting. Gets rid of puffiness first thing in the morning.

R30VUK7NMX8KBT,So many uses for this lavender oil,I am very happy with the Lavender essential oil from skinology ! It comes In a big size 4 fl oz glass bottle and dropper.  This is made of 100% pure lavender oil so you don't have to worry about there being any other ingredients that shouldn't be in there.  This lavender oil has many uses! You can use this in massages or help with stress or congestion or other issues you may be having . I also have been using this in bedrooms that the animals have either been in or made messes in the past. I put a few drops in the corners of the room and it seems to take the smell out of the room very well.<br /><br />I received this at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion.
R139G1YAWZKX85,I love love love the smell,"I love love love the smell, taste, and look of this stuff. Lost my other one so I had to reorder!"

R2Y1ULZDF4NR0X,Moisturizer absorbs quickly leaving my face soft and refreshed!  I love it!,"This Peels and Petals Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixl advertises that it is for all skin types and I believe it.  My face is a combination of oily and dry.  There are areas on my face that are more sensitive as well. I followed the suggested directions. I first cleaned my face and applied the product daily.  I like to use this product first thing in the morning after washing my face.  My reasoning for that is that when I use it I feel so refreshed.  It had a hint of peppermint fragrance and when I apply it to my face it tingles and feels like my face it waking up.  I know that sounds silly, but it feels great!  I love the fact that although the moisturizer has substance and looks thick when I put it on my fingers, it is completely absorbed into my skin within a minute of putting it on my face.  There is no oily or sticky residue.  My skin simply feels soft.<br /><br />I like the fact that the Vitamin C in this moisturizer has been shown to reduce the effects of UV exposure and that it contains Vitamin E, which we all know is an antioxidant and is extremely good for your skin. I've read articles that tout the use of green tea on your face as well.  I guess it is no surprise given the ingredients contained in this product that it works so well and feels so good on my skin!  This is a product that I am definitely going to keep using.<br /><br />This product was purchased at a discount so that I could test it and give my honest evaluation of how this product worked for me.  I have not been compensated in any other way.  My opinion was not influenced by the seller or anyone else."

R2H1AA7FKCHH8E,Normani is a very pretty mauve color,"Normani is a very pretty mauve color. The brush is very narrow, which makes it hard to apply evenly. The color is worth it. Great for fall and winter."
R1E7KIM9NOCJJZ,Love these,Was surprised when I got these. Look better in person. These fit better than any of the knuckle rings I've purchased. The only issue I have...it turned my finger green. So I would suggest taking a clear nail polish and paint them before you wear them to keep them from turning your finger green as well. But I'm pleased otherwise.
R1K5GAG92TLYFX,Five Stars,"They are very high quality and very sharp, so be careful with your lips."
R1QZQIF4J2L6WA,i am impressed,"I ordered this product after I read about it in a magazine.  I am impressed.  I can already see a difference in my skin.  I have a brown mark on my forehead and also some on the side of my face by my eyes.  They are all fading and now I can barely see the spot on my forehead.  Goes on smoothly.  I use it everyday on my face, neck and chest.  I haven't had any issues as reported by some reviewers.  A little goes a long way.  I will be ordering more of this."

RYKL70CCQI6G5,Happy Shaver,The Phillips Norelco electric shaver performs very well both at home and while traveling. The cleaning is easiest at home with the cartridge filled charger and cleaner. Being on the road just required a quick rinse under the faucet. I had plenty of charge left after a three-week vacation. I am getting closer shaves than my previous Norelco model.

RNIY97DC57DU8,Broke in less than 3 months!!,I love this toothbrush but I am very disappointed that I bought it in June of 2015 and it has already broke.  The brush won't spin anymore.  I thought getting it here cheaper than at a store was a good deal but obviously it backfired.
R3J3APNQEVY9JO,Great for At Home Coloring,I was looking for a kit that had everything I needed for at home coloring and this seemed to fit the bill.  The order arrived within a few days and was well packaged.  The items are exactly as described and I have used them already.  I like them a lot.  The price was great and overall was a great transaction.

I mean I think it’s a big part of communication for everyone, but I really think of my teeth as one of my primary features. Which is why it was disconcerting when they started to yellow. I used this product, just a few times and it worked out and my teeth are back to normal again. I will just have to keep using this product every once a while."

R3BKDI567AU83C,Barely lifted the color.,"I had a very pretty blue in my hair. But it faded to a nasty green. I was looking for a safe alternative to bleaching. I found this, and the product has some great reviews. But it didn't lift my color at all. I followed the directions to a tee. I attached a before and after photo. You can see that the green is only slightly less obvious, or maybe that's me being hopeful I didn't waste $15 and an hour of my time. I assume this would lift other colors. But it doesn't not work for blue/green hair."
R18IMSZ0DAZ6AT,"Fast absorbtion, non greasy.",I've been using emu oil for many years recently I had the opportunity to try Emu Bliss for a very fair price point. The Emu Bliss Pure Emu Oil is easily absorbed and leaves your skin feeling moisturized without feeling greasy. I also use the emu oil as a rub on aching joints after tough workouts or long days.

REY0LY9WCABFZ,A Long Lasting Clean,"I have had the privilege to use 3D Crest White Brilliance Daily Cleansing and Whitening System thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. I have been using whitening strips, toothpastes, and even light systems in the past When I received the cleansing and whitening system I was very excited to open it up and try it out. I was a little taken back by the gritty feeling that I had from using the cleansing paste. However, when I followed it with the whitening paste as directed my mouth felt amazing and the gritty feeling was gone. Even after eating my mouth still feels clean thanks to this system. I have always hated that with other toothpastes my mouth would feel like I need to brush again after eating anything.<br /><br />The mint wasn't too overpowering and left your mouth feeling fresh. I had a hard time at first remembering not to rinse my toothbrush between steps but eventually I got the swing of it and it worked great! I also never experienced any staining issues or sensitivities that tend to come along with whitening products. This has turned out to be a great product! My teeth are visibly whiter thanks to this system and I will continue to purchase it for myself and my husband."
R13V6Y39FE81WY,Very nice nail file,Very nice nail file.  More gentle than any that I have tried including other ceramic ones.  I like it a lot.  You can see the nail being shaped as little powdery particles roll off the nail.  Does not seam to tear or damage my nails.  This is a good thing as my nails seem to peel a lot and I believe part of it is the bad nail files I have used.

RP31278R9SI9P,they changed the formula!,"i've been buying this for a long time. they just changed the formula and it's not thin and quick drying like it used to be. it's quite thick like the HA and takes a while to dry. i also use the HA, so it takes MUCH longer now for both of them to dry. i'll keep using it because you CANNOT beat the results for the price, but just don't expect the nice, quick drying, light feeling serum like before....  UPDATE: i'm still using this product, and love it. AND i just found out it's cruelty free! couldn't be happier with that news. thanks OZ naturals!  :)"

RA4RFG3J5IEEX,I love this scent,"I love this scent!  Only criticisms I would have is that I wish it smelled more like the deodorant version of it, and I wish it lasted a bit longer.  Otherwise, it's my go to option for regular days."
R3J2DLUMA5CFPR,Didn't really do anything,"This honestly did not do anything for me. I have used it for 2 months. But then again, no other skin lightening product has worked on me either. I guess my particular skin is just un-lighten-able, haha.  This cream is a bit runny. It is also uncomfortably sticky, so you can't really lather it on like a smooth silky lotion (which you could do with lightening creams such as Caro White for example). Since it's so sticky, I'm assuming its meant to be dotted onto the areas that are dark instead of lightening the body as a whole, but even still the texture is sticky and a bit nasty feeling. It also has a perfume-y smell, which I didn't mind that much."
R1W6MZLWJMM4H2,I liked the product,"I liked the product, barely could tell I had it on. However, it goes so fast! I only applied like 2x per day (with the correct bare minerals brush) and needed more in a month!"

I was able to stop leeks with night time diapers but around 10months it wasn't working anymore. I would change him around 3am, still wet through. So I tried at 4am, same. Then I found these at a large chain baby store.  Haven't leeked through since!  Happy mama, happy baby, happy life!"

R11HEY071DJRNF,A really great liner that is a perfect dark brown.,"I am a makeup LOVER, so I jumped at the chance to purchase this liner at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  All of the opinions in this review are one hundred percent my own and in no way have they been fed to me by someone else.<br />I purchased the pencil in dark brown and the color is exactly what I expected.  A true brown, more cool than warm, and not so dark that it reads as black.  A great shade.<br />The liner smooths on nicely, doesn't tug at the eyelid or require too much pressure.  And it smudges nicely as well.  Very little work needed to get the look I was going for.<br />The liner stays put. I wore it to a barbecue yesterday and through the humidity and a bit of rain, it did not budge.  The color stayed true and nothing was running or fading out.<br />I have worn it a couple times now and I just love it.  I have pretty sensitive skin and have not had any kind of reaction to the formula so all in all this is a win for me.  I really like this line!"
R35ZU0FVGP0EP8,BEST BB CREAM FOR PALE COMPLEXIONS,This is literally the best bb cream ever especially for pale girls like me. I am extremely fair and have freckles as well as a few blemishes every now and then and this COVERS EVERYTHING. It is my one step make up in the morning and it stays on so well. I dont even use a concealer if i use this! The only thing that is so-so about it is that it leaves your face a little shiny but all Korean BB Cream does that and a little translucent powder fixes that. THE BEST.

R2IW0SHUUAVJ2Y,Don't buy this,It doesn't work. Awkward to use and there is no leverage.
R1ZKCVD1DMMYH1,probably my fault as I am not good with hair,"It seems very awkward to use, probably my fault as I am not good with hair.  It certainly gets very hot, ad a friend of mine swears by it."
R2VS4WMWXLN7C1,Three Stars,Its ok
RCOT0ZSID8EOY,too heavy. Broke on the first night after received.,"I bought this a couple of weeks ago. I attached it on my full body mirror overnight just to see if it will hold really good. FYI, I cleaned my mirror first as well as the suction cup of this thing before I put it on, just to make sure that it will stay really good... Sadly, in the middle of the night, it fell off and when i woke up to check it, a part of it was broken (meaning I cannot return it back anymore).  The other reviews are correct. The material that was used to build this product is already very heavy enough, how much more if you would put a hair dryer on it. For people who are wanting to buy this product, I would suggest that you put it on when you are gonna use it but detach it after use. Sounds like a lot of work but it is how it is. :)"
RN0WJYRG2SXHI,"Great scent,.","Love the scent and the extra travel parfum. However, the top on the travel one is designed poorly. Once opened it will not fit back on properly and I am losing perfume!"
R13UZ3K9BDYAD6,Peppermint oil ftw,"This stuff is great. I use it for home, car and at work. Just little drops through out the space not only makes it smell amazing but helps get rid of spiders. They don't like the smell of peppermint oil (and I don't like spiders), it is too strong for them so they leave. The smell in general is very calming but yet wakes up all my senses and keeps me alert. Best smell ever."
R2DI2IQ0HL89OR,I love it,I love it  but is a little too overprice for me
R3TE6RH2FJSMG2,awesome!,awesome!!!
R3F7IRKKB5WY3J,"Big, noisy and not that great of a shave!","My husband bought this and I hated it. It took up so much room on our bathroom counter AND it was noisy (while it self-cleaned). It would self clean randomly at all hours of the day. I could not stand this thing! I did not say anything to my husband about how annoying it was because if he liked it, it was worth it. However, I asked him if he liked the shaves he was getting with it, and he said NO! The razor was about as good as his last $30 razor. This razor is total junk!"

R1LYJKJPUT68TF,"The knock, the solution","I was very excited to be invited into this campaign.  I can't believe I was given a free, $300.00+ electric razor to try out.  This is what bzzagent is all about in my mind.<br /><br />I currently use a safety razor to shave 2-3 times week.  I can't shave back to back days because it will just chew up my skin.  Plus with the safety razor, I will usually only get one sweet shave with a blade.  When the blade is too sharp, or too dull, I cut myself.  I think they call it the art of shaving for a reason - because you're supposed to take your time and go slow.  However, at 5:30am, with one eye open, no coffee, two kids to get out the door to school and trying to get to work by 730am, time is not on my side.  I cannot enjoy my shave.  I need to get in and out and on with my day.<br /><br />My free razor arrived at my door on Tuesday.  After a quick change (60 minutes charge gets you 50 minutes of shaving?!  Nice), I was looking forward to using it on Wednesday morning.<br /><br />Now shaving with a straight razor is obviously different than shaving with an electric.  I'm going to have to get my electric feet back under me, not having used one for many years now, but my first shave went well and more importantly fast.  After my shave, the razor indicated it needed to be cleaned with the cleaning system.  I'm not sure how often that is going to happen.  My father's biggest complaint about his Braun is the cost of the replacement cleaning solutions.  After the shave, on a quick inspection of my face, I could see I missed a few spots, but that was user error.  I have to get my no-shaving cream system down.  I could also tell some areas were not as smooth as a straight razor would get them as well however again, that may be user error.  My beard grows in multiple directions.  I would normally shave 2-3 times with a straight razor to get everything - yet another reason I was excited for this product.  It claims it cuts in multiple directions in one swoop.<br /><br />Day 2 seemed to go better than the first day.  A feature I embraced today that I hadn't yesterday was locking the pivoting head to get areas that are missed.  This is great for areas like under your nose and some angles on my neck where I need a little less give and some more &#34;go get it&#34;.<br /><br />Ongoing... Ive been using the razor for over a week and enjoying it.  My mornings have sped up and I'm still getting a nice shave.  Each day I feel I learn more about how to shave better than the day prior.  I can see this is going to be a good relationship ongoing.<br /><br />The final test - I went camping for a few days and had to chop off my beard once I got back.  I don't have the thickest or fullest beard, but because my hair grows in every direction, in the past, electric razors would take a long time and not get the job done well.  However, within a couple of minutes I was able to get a solid shave.<br /><br />I am truly enjoying this product and look forward to using this ongoing.  Great product!<br /><br />Updated 9/24/2015<br />I've been using the Braun Series 9090 daily for over a month now.  I'm<br />still loving it.  I like how my face looks and feels but love not<br />lathering up, shaving in all directions and cutting myself almost<br />daily.  I now longer have to plan my shaving around important events<br />in my life.  It's more like getting a small haircut each day.<br /><br />The knock I've had with all shavers is the upkeep and cost.  Cleaning<br />electric razorsh has always been tedious but not with the Cleaning<br />Center.  Pop it in and walk away.<br /><br />As for cost, the cleaning center needs refills of the cleaning<br />solution.  I used a Braun cleaning center years ago and going to CVS<br />and the cost started to wear on me.  Howver, now living in the Amazon<br />world, I found a solid subscribe and save<br />(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SNGSFS?ref_=sns_myd_detail_page).<br />A little over $4 per refill is awesome.  I even sharedthis with my<br />father who complained about wanting to get away from his Braun when I<br />told him I was using one again.<br /><br />And I beleive you need to change out the head every 18-months or so.<br />A quick Amazon search shows series 9 heads going for $50.  So over the<br />span of 18-months, you need to spend an additional $6.70 in upkeep.<br />That's right in line with all the via-snail mail shaving clubs without<br />needing shaving cream, after shave and the worry of blood.<br /><br />I'm sold.ad every 18-months or so.

R33LBIWAG7IUOG,Below average product,I have used this shampoo for years and I know it is good. I don't know what was done to this bottle but it was watered down so bad that it would not even lather. Will not be buying again.
R1RH217B610JXU,Wear it everyday,Wear this everyday to work. So easy and lightweight. I cut about 4 inches off
R28OCE4WM0TAKB,It's a great product it works great,"When I first tried Crest 3D White I was really impressed by its power, I received it in the mail to test for free from Crest through BzzAgent. At first I was skeptical about it because I herd a lot of people complaining their teeth became sensitive after  using whitening products but I was pleasantly surprised I was not one of them.It's a great product it works great.My teeth are significantly whiter and they stay that way.I love how easy the two step process worked. Brush with step 1 for 1 minute, spit, brush with step 2 for 1 minute, spit and rinse and you’re done. Very easy and did not add any extra time to my routine and you get a great result.I will definitely be buying more when I run out."
R11YI9U8J1YSQ8,great product,Just received product. It came on time and smells great. Will purchase again. They soap lathers well and the wonderful scent lingers but is not too overpowering
R4WYW1A4UTFWA,Beauty in a Bottle!,"I received a generous discount on this product and I'm very pleased to say the least! I use a lot of styling products and prefer to use natural hair conditioners to keep myhair healthy and Castor oil is a key ingredient combined with (2) egg yolks, equal parts castor oil, coconut oil and evvo which is my weekly deep condtioner treatment! Pure Farms castor oil blended very well, no irration, dyes or perfumes and works great with facial mask as well!"

RP4NX5IW7ZJTN,Five Stars,Very moisturizing
R1VNB61A7GFKL4,Excellent Facial Spray,"I have a strong sense of smell and when I sprayed the rose water on my face and neck, I immediately washed it off because the scent was just too rosey and intolerable.  So I decided to take it to work and give it to a co-worker who can use it. When I was at work, I had pulled out the bottle out of my bag and I decided to read the info on the back of the bottle before I pass it on to someone.  Do to the benefits, I decided to keep it.  I tried it again by spraying a mist on my face and temples and hair and fell in love with it.  The scent was milder and refreshing and after the 4th day of using it, my face has gotten clearer and it somewhat glows. I use it just about every day. I'm so glad I didn't give it away. My senses of smell must have been strong the first day I tried it due to allergies.  I plan on purchasing another bottle for my teen daughter so she can use it as a moisturizer and to help clear her skin as well."
R230LCPQDOFJJZ,Five Stars,Excellent dryer.
R1XMFH18LCZGT5,Great price,"Paid less than half of what CVS charges,  and I haven't been able to get my color in my local store.  Very happy."
R2C1TMK9CYCAPA,Four Stars,Good quality but doesn't look much like the picture.
R2IGWA5VHK4O,Good hair freshener between washes,"This style refresher isn't the greatest but works as advertised. It is easy to use - just 1-2 pumps into the hands and work the foam into the hair evenly, then style as usual. It helps reduce the oily appearance without the hold of a gel, which tends to weigh the hair down. It's works great as a mid-day touch up freshener between washes. However, I don't particularly like the scent. It's a not bad smell, more of a manly scent but a little overwhelming. It would have been perfect if they dial down the smell a little. I like the refreshed look on my hair but not the added smell, which can be quite noticeable."
R20QHYEZ6UDDJ9,Overall GREAT,Perfect other than a bit of clumping. The first brush is AMAZING. The second one does a great job with filling out the lashes but it's a clumper. Just a bit. Just a bit.
R31T8JE0F78P3S,Five Stars,Cool

R3JFKQEN2X8L4X,Pretty neat and saves me money when i only need a bang cut.,"This is really neat and helpful.  After receiving this Worry free Goodie Hair Tolls Bang Cut Thinning scissor, I was really excited to give it a try.  The set comes with hair cutting/thinning shears and a clip on device with a level indicator on it.  This is to help give yourself a bangs haircut without help and to get a straight cut.  The clip has a type of hinged clip to keep it closed and inside the clip and lots of tiny teeth like pieces to keep it in your hair.  After you put it around the hair you want to cut you simply clip it closed and make sure your level and straight with the little bubble level on the front.<br /><br />I started my bangs were really long and I always cut them myself, and the next day I always end up with a crooked line or lots of hairs that did not get cut so I end up cutting again to get it right.  After figuring how to get it were I needed it and making sure it was straight, I cut my bangs.  I have to admit that it did do a pretty good job and the cut was straight.  This is going to be very helpful for me since I have bangs that grow quite fast.  After telling my neighbor about it, she wants to try it on her bangs to.  We successfully cut her bangs with the clip also.  I did not use this to thin my hair since I already have thin hair but it does come with thinning sheers.  We were pleased with the outcome and I will only get better at it with time.<br /><br />I believe this is a good product and the clip holds pretty well, because there are no English instructions I was going to give it four stars, but after watching the videos on you tube and seeing what it could do I also used this on the back of my hair and it came out great and it worked so well it deserves the five star rating.<br />I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
R2NSJ6O8Y9O4K8,Easy to use and put together,"Easy to use and put together. When they are not in use, they come apart and can lay in drawer without taking up to much space."

R20GV2HDG0U2V5,bad nails sure do beat the alternative,"My nails were permanently damaged from the ravages of chemo therapy received years ago....but, bad nails sure do beat the alternative!!  I have tried every product available to strengthen and protect my nails from splitting, but until I found Nailtiques Formula 2, nothing helped.  This product protects and strengthens my nails, and even though I still have one weak nail, it is so much stronger and all 10 are so much healthier!  I enjoy getting pedicures, but wouldn't get a manicure, because of the shape my nails were in.  I'm so thankful for the introduction to this product from my nail salon --- I now can enjoy an occasional manicure as a special treat because my nails look great!  LOVE this product!"
RN95N3MZ1C9VQ,Absolutely love coastal scents eye shadows but it came damaged!,Love coastal scents shadows! It's the 3rd set I've bought but it came damaged and it's not the 1st set that came damaged!!! I let it slide the first time! I am kind of upset! 😕
R3HJJPH7KV6LYB,"Woodsy scent, too much citrus smell","I decided to try the wisdom woodsy scent after using a different brand's beard balm. The first thing I noticed smelling the bottle is a really strong lemon scent. I wish I'd seen that before I purchased.<br /><br />As far as oils go, it works as well as any other oil I've tried."
R1ZWGVBPEZ51B,What I wanted.,Needed a salt jar for the bags of ground sea salt that I pick up for cooking/baking. Love the quality of the thick blue glass!
RFOZZ89BTPXSA,Re-formulated garbage - DO NOT BUY!,"The original formula was a 5-star product. This new formula with astazanthin (spelling?) is utter GARBAGE and doesn't deserve one star. Oz has added this ingredient plus several nasty chemicals/preservatives that weren't in the original formula, in addition, this once easy to apply serum is now a gelatinous mess that really smells bad. Maybe they reformulated it to lower the production costs? Will not purchase this again and have moved on to another brand.  The original formula worked beautifully for fine lines, hyper-pigmentation and as a mild exfoliant. This new formula is just awful. Don't waste your time or money on this product.  Shame on you Oz Naturals!!"
RHIQYPS96LQIM,👍,💖
R1ZH2O68J8EZSV,Love it!,"I bought this as an add on item. When I first received the product it looked kind of grainy that's why I deducted a star, but I have to say that it keeps me moisturised all day long. Scent is great it's like a faint almond not overpowering.  Most butters leave a greasy after feeling but not this one. I use it on hair, face and body just what I needed. This is an honest review. I did not receive this product for free or discounted so this a legit review."

RSTHZGUQG4GOG,"Effective, but Thick and Messy","Good product for helping hair stay moisturized and come back thicker. However, the castor oil itself is quite thick and messy. Overall 4 star product."
R3R1SG25IISEZW,Not much help for dematitis,"I have a rather unpleasant issue with seborrheic dermatitis on the scalp that causes flaking that also creates dry scabs on the backs of my ear lobes. I bought this product in an effort to alleviate the symptoms without much mess. This product didn't make very much of a difference in the two weeks I used it. It does provide a distinct tingling sensation caused by its ingredients, but don't be fooled. It serves no purpose. I found little to no results after extended use and also the droplet method of delivery is messy and leaves much to be desired. I have fine hair and this product made my hair look greasy after applying it immediately after washing my hair. Overall it may work for others with other scalp issues but it didn't help mine."
